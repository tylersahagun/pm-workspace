## Key Concepts

### Cohorts vs Groups (Critical Distinction)

Understanding when to use cohorts vs groups is essential for correct analysis.

| Concept     | What It Is                    | Use Case                     | Example                                          |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Cohorts** | Groups of **people**          | **Filtering** analysis       | "Show funnel for users who completed onboarding" |
| **Groups**  | Tied to **events** by company | **Aggregation** by workspace | "How many unique companies activated this week?" |

**Cohorts (People-based):**

- Two types: **Behavioral** (did/didn't do X) and **Property-based** (has attribute Y)
- Use for filtering any analysis to specific user segments
- Examples:
  - "Users who have never created a workflow"
  - "Users who stopped using meeting recorder"
  - "Users with role = manager"

**Groups (Event-based):**

- Every event associated with a workspace
- Enables company-level metrics
- Use `$groups: { workspace: workspaceId }` in capture calls
- Examples:
  - "How many unique companies used chat this week?"
  - "Which companies have declining usage?"

**Decision Framework:**

```
Need to filter by user behavior/attributes? → Use Cohort
Need to aggregate by company/workspace? → Use Group
Need both? → Filter by cohort, aggregate by group
```

### Value Ladder (Time-to-Value Framework)

AskElephant has multiple levels of value delivery. Track activation at each tier.

| Tier             | Description                              | Key Events                                          | Target   |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| **Basic**        | Meeting notes, follow-ups, briefings     | `meeting:processed`, `email:sent`                   | Day 1    |
| **Intermediate** | CRM connected, syncing properly          | `hubspot_agent:enabled`, `salesforce_agent:enabled` | Week 1   |
| **Deep**         | Workflows running, automation delivering | `workflows:run_completed` with success              | Week 2-4 |
| **Power**        | Multiple integrations, team adoption     | Multi-user workspace activity                       | Month 1+ |

**Measuring Time-to-Value:**

- Track time from signup to each tier
- Build funnels for tier progression
- Segment by persona (reps reach Basic fast, RevOps reach Deep)

See: `pm-workspace-docs/status/posthog-value-ladder.md`

### Question-First Approach

**Don't audit 700 insights.** Start with business questions and work backward.

**Process:**

1. Start with business question (e.g., "How many users use search?")
2. Search for existing insights that might answer it
3. If found, verify data looks correct
4. If not found, identify what events are needed
5. Check if those events exist in PostHog
6. Build insight OR identify instrumentation gap

Use `/posthog question [query]` to follow this process.

### North Star Metric

A North Star Metric captures the core value customers derive from your product. It has three defining qualities:

1. **Represents value to users** - not just activity
2. **Within product/marketing's control** - team can influence it
3. **Leading indicator of revenue** - predicts business outcomes

**AskElephant North Star:**

```
"Workspaces with ≥3 successful workflow runs per week"
```

**Why this metric:**

- Captures automated value (the core "agentic" value proposition)
- Leading indicator of retention and expansion
- Within product team's control
- Differentiates from competitors (not just meeting notes)

**Avoid Vanity Metrics:**

- Raw signups (no value context)
- Pageviews (no engagement quality)
- Total users (includes churned)

See: `pm-workspace-docs/research/metrics-framework-best-practices.md`

### Aha Moment Framework

The "aha moment" is when a user first experiences core product value. It has three components:

| Component       | Definition            | Example                               |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Action**      | The specific behavior | "Workflow run completes successfully" |
| **Frequency**   | How many times        | "≥3 times"                            |
| **Time Period** | When it should happen | "Within first 14 days"                |

**Proposed Aha Moments by Persona:**

| Persona   | Candidate Aha Moment                              | Validate By           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Sales Rep | "Received briefing before 3 meetings in 7 days"   | Compare 90d retention |
| Manager   | "Viewed team dashboard with ≥5 meetings"          | Compare 90d retention |
| RevOps    | "1 workflow ran successfully ≥3 times in 14 days" | Compare 90d retention |
| CSM       | "Renewal insights surfaced for ≥2 accounts"       | Compare 90d retention |

### Customer Health Score Framework

A Customer Health Score consolidates multiple signals into a single predictive score (0-100).

**Signal Domains:**

| Domain        | Weight | What It Measures                    |
| ------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Usage**     | 30%    | DAU/MAU ratio, seat utilization     |
| **Value**     | 25%    | Workflow success rate, tier reached |
| **Trend**     | 20%    | WoW usage change                    |
| **Fit**       | 15%    | Integrations enabled, features used |
| **Technical** | 10%    | Error rate, latency                 |

**Health Thresholds:**

| Score  | Label        | Action              |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------------- |
| 80-100 | **Healthy**  | Expansion candidate |
| 60-79  | **Stable**   | Monitor             |
| 40-59  | **At-Risk**  | Proactive outreach  |
| 0-39   | **Critical** | Urgent intervention |

### Engagement Scoring

Weight events by predictive power for retention:

| Event                               | Points | Rationale                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------- |
| `workflows:run_completed` (success) | 100    | Core value delivery       |
| `hubspot_agent:contact_synced`      | 80     | Stickiness behavior       |
| `chat:conversation_created`         | 50     | Engagement indicator      |
| `meeting:processed`                 | 40     | Basic value               |
| `search:query_executed`             | 20     | Active exploration        |
| `login`                             | 5      | Basic access (low signal) |

**Formula:** `Engagement Score = Σ(Event × Weight) / Max Possible Score`

## Thirteen Operating Modes

### Mode 1: Audit (`/posthog audit`)

Analyze current PostHog setup, identify gaps, compare to best practices.

**Process:**

1. Fetch current state using PostHog MCP tools:
   - `posthog-event-definitions-list` - Current events
   - `posthog-dashboards-get-all` - Existing dashboards
   - `posthog-feature-flag-get-all` - Feature flags
   - `posthog-experiments-get-all` - Active experiments
   - `posthog-surveys-get-all` - Survey coverage
   - `posthog-list-errors` - Error tracking status
2. Compare against best practices from audit document
3. Identify gaps and opportunities
4. Generate actionable report

**Output Format:**

```markdown

---

### Mode 2: Dashboard (`/posthog dashboard [initiative]`)

Create or update a PostHog dashboard for an initiative.

**Process:**

1. Load initiative PRD: `pm-workspace-docs/initiatives/[name]/PRD.md`
2. Extract success criteria and key behaviors from outcome chain
3. Check if dashboard exists for initiative (check `_meta.json`)
4. Create/update dashboard with relevant insights
5. Update initiative `_meta.json` with dashboard reference

**Insight Types to Include:**

| Metric Type | PostHog Query                          | When to Use    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Adoption    | Trend of unique users doing key action | Feature launch |
| Retention   | Retention cohort by first usage        | Stickiness     |
| Funnel      | Multi-step conversion                  | User journeys  |
| Engagement  | Event frequency over time              | Feature usage  |
| Errors      | Error rate for feature area            | Quality        |

**Creating Insights:**

Use `posthog-query-run` to test queries first, then `posthog-insight-create-from-query` to save:

```json
{
  "kind": "InsightVizNode",
  "source": {
    "kind": "TrendsQuery",
    "series": [
      {
        "kind": "EventsNode",
        "event": "event_name",
        "custom_name": "Metric Name",
        "math": "dau"
      }
    ],
    "interval": "day",
    "dateRange": { "date_from": "-30d" }
  }
}
```

**Update `_meta.json`:**

```json
{
  "posthog": {
    "dashboard_id": 1234567,
    "dashboard_url": "https://us.posthog.com/project/81505/dashboard/1234567",
    "insights": [
      { "id": "abc123", "name": "Daily Active Users", "type": "trend" },
      { "id": "def456", "name": "Feature Funnel", "type": "funnel" }
    ],
    "last_updated": "YYYY-MM-DD"
  }
}
```

**Output Format:**

```markdown
# Dashboard Created: [Initiative Name]

**Dashboard ID:** [id]
**URL:** [PostHog URL]

## Insights Added

| Insight | Type   | Metric              |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| [Name]  | Trend  | DAU for [event]     |
| [Name]  | Funnel | [Step 1] → [Step 2] |

## Success Criteria Mapping

| PRD Criterion        | PostHog Insight | Target         |
| -------------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| [criterion from PRD] | [insight name]  | [target value] |

## Next Steps

- [ ] Set up alerts for critical metrics
- [ ] Add to `/status` checks
```

---

### Mode 3: Metrics (`/posthog metrics [initiative]`)

Define and create success metrics for an initiative linked to PostHog.

**Process:**

1. Load initiative PRD for outcome chain
2. Identify primary and secondary metrics
3. Check what events exist that support these metrics
4. Create PostHog insights for each metric
5. Update `_meta.json` with metrics configuration
6. Generate instrumentation gaps if events missing

**Metric Categories:**

| Category   | Examples               | PostHog Math            |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Adoption   | Users who used feature | `dau`, `unique_session` |
| Engagement | Actions per user       | `sum`, `avg` per user   |
| Retention  | Users returning        | Retention query         |
| Conversion | Funnel completion      | Funnel query            |
| Quality    | Error rate, latency    | Formula                 |

**Output Format:**

      ],
      "secondary": [{ "name": "[Name]", "insight_id": "[id]" }]
    }
  }
}
```
````

## Next Steps

1. [Engineering task if instrumentation needed]
2. [Dashboard task if insights need creation]

````

**Save to:** Initiative folder as `METRICS.md`

---

### Mode 4: Cohorts (`/posthog cohorts`)

Create and manage user cohorts for segmentation. Remember: cohorts are **people-based** for **filtering** (see Key Concepts above).

**Two Types of Cohorts:**

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Behavioral** | Users who did/didn't do something | "Users who completed onboarding" |
| **Property-based** | Users with specific attributes | "Users where role = manager" |

**Standard Behavioral Cohorts:**

| Cohort | Definition | Use Case |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Power Users | `workflows:run_started` ≥5 times in 30d | Beta testers, champions |
| At-Risk | Usage drop >30% WoW | Churn prevention |
| Chat Adopters | `chat_created` ≥3 times in 30d | Feature feedback |
| Workflow Heavy | `workflows:run_started` ≥50 in 30d | Success stories |
| Onboarding Complete | `onboarding:flow_completed` in 90d | Activation tracking |
| Onboarding Abandoned | `onboarding:step_viewed` AND NOT `onboarding:flow_completed` | Dropoff analysis |
| HubSpot Users | `hubspot_agent:enabled` in 30d | CRM integration |
| Mobile Users | Any `mobile:*` event in 30d | Mobile adoption |
| Value Tier: Basic | `meeting:processed` in 7d | Basic activation |
| Value Tier: Intermediate | `hubspot_agent:enabled` OR `salesforce_agent:enabled` | CRM activation |
| Value Tier: Deep | `workflows:run_completed` ≥10 in 30d | Automation activation |

**Standard Property-based Cohorts:**

| Cohort | Property Criteria | Use Case |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| Sales Reps | `role` = "user" | IC persona analysis |
| Managers | `role` = "manager" | Leader persona analysis |
| Admins | `role` = "owner" | Admin behavior |
| Enterprise | `plan` = "enterprise" | Enterprise vs SMB |

**External Data Note:**
To create cohorts from external data (e.g., HubSpot partner field), you must first sync that data to PostHog person profiles. PostHog cannot create cohorts from data it doesn't have.

**Process:**
1. List existing cohorts (check PostHog or local tracking)
2. Map to persona types (see company-context/personas.md)
3. Map to value ladder tiers
4. Identify gaps based on initiative needs
5. Provide cohort creation guidance (PostHog UI required)
6. Document cohort definitions

**Output Format:**

```markdown
# Cohort Analysis

**Generated:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Existing Cohorts

| Name | Definition | Size | Last Updated |
|------|------------|------|--------------|
| [name] | [criteria] | [count] | [date] |

## Recommended Cohorts

### [Name]
- **Definition:** [behavioral criteria]
- **Use Case:** [why needed]
- **Priority:** High/Medium/Low

## Creation Instructions

PostHog UI: People → Cohorts → New Cohort

For "[Cohort Name]":
1. Click "Add matching criteria"
2. Select: Completed event "[event_name]"
3. Set: at least [N] times in last [X] days
4. Save

## Initiative Mapping

| Initiative | Relevant Cohorts |
|------------|------------------|
| [name] | [cohort 1], [cohort 2] |
````

**Save to:** `pm-workspace-docs/status/posthog-cohorts.md`

---

### Mode 5: Alerts (`/posthog alerts`)

Set up proactive alerting for critical metrics.

**Standard Alerts:**

| Alert             | Metric                 | Threshold      | Frequency |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------- | --------- |
| WAU Drop          | Weekly Active Users    | Decreases >10% | Weekly    |
| Workflow Failures | `workflows:run_failed` | >100/day       | Daily     |
| Bot Failures      | `recall:bot_fatal`     | >50/day        | Daily     |
| Recording Success | Recording success rate | <90%           | Daily     |
| Error Spike       | Exception count        | >200% baseline | Hourly    |

**Process:**

1. Check existing insights that could have alerts
2. Identify critical metrics missing alerts
3. Create alert-ready insights using `posthog-insight-create-from-query`
4. Document alert configuration (alerts set in PostHog UI)

**Output Format:**

```markdown
# Alert Configuration

**Generated:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Active Alerts

| Alert Name | Insight      | Threshold   | Notify        |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| [name]     | [insight_id] | [condition] | [email/slack] |

## Recommended Alerts

### [Alert Name]

- **Metric:** [what to monitor]
- **Insight ID:** [id] (create if needed)
- **Condition:** Decreases by / Increases above [threshold]
- **Frequency:** Daily/Weekly/Hourly
- **Urgency:** Critical/Warning

## Setup Instructions

For each alert:

1. Open insight: [URL]
2. Click Alerts (bell icon)
3. New Alert → Configure threshold
4. Set notification: tyler.sahagun@askelephant.ai

## Alert Response Playbook

### WAU Drop Alert

1. Check for outages or deploy issues
2. Review feature flag changes
3. Check by platform (web/mobile/desktop)
4. Investigate specific cohorts

### Workflow Failures Alert

1. Check error logs for pattern
2. Identify affected workspaces
3. Escalate if >5% of total runs
```

**Save to:** `pm-workspace-docs/status/posthog-alerts.md`

---

### Mode 6: Instrument (`/posthog instrument [feature]`)

Generate event tracking recommendations for a feature area.

**Process:**

1. Load current events using `posthog-event-definitions-list`
2. Identify feature area from argument
3. Analyze what events exist vs what's needed
4. Generate instrumentation plan with naming conventions
5. Create Linear ticket if engineering work needed

**Naming Convention:**

```
domain:entity:action

Examples:
- chat:conversation:created
- workflow:run:started
- hubspot:contact:synced
- meeting:recording:completed
```

**Event Properties Standard:**

| Property          | Required    | Description         |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| `workspaceId`     | Yes         | For group analytics |
| `workspaceName`   | Yes         | Human-readable      |
| `userId`          | Auto        | PostHog handles     |
| `feature_version` | Recommended | For A/B context     |
| `platform`        | Recommended | web/mobile/desktop  |

**Output Format:**

````markdown
# Instrumentation Plan: [Feature Area]

**Generated:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** [New / Update]

## Current Events

| Event     | Last Seen | Volume      | Has Workspace Context |
| --------- | --------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| `[event]` | [date]    | [count/day] | ✅/❌                 |

## Gaps Identified

### Missing Events

| Event                    | Purpose          | Priority |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | -------- |
| `[domain:entity:action]` | [what it tracks] | High     |

### Events Needing Updates

| Event     | Issue                     | Fix                              |
| --------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `[event]` | Missing workspace context | Add `$groups: { workspace: id }` |

## Implementation Guide

### New Event: `[event_name]`

**When to fire:** [trigger condition]

**Properties:**

```typescript
posthog.capture(
  "[event_name]",
  {
    workspaceId: currentWorkspaceId,
    workspaceName: currentWorkspaceName,
    // feature-specific properties
    property_name: value,
  },
  {
    $groups: { workspace: currentWorkspaceId },
  },
);
```
````

**Location:** `elephant-ai/web/src/[path]`

## Linear Ticket

**Title:** Add PostHog events for [feature]
**Description:** [Generated from this plan]
**Labels:** analytics, instrumentation
**Priority:** [P1-P4]

````

**Save to:** `pm-workspace-docs/research/instrumentation/[feature]-events.md`

---

### Mode 7: Question (`/posthog question [query]`)

Answer business questions using the question-first approach. This mode searches existing insights, checks for events, and identifies gaps.

**Process:**
1. Parse the business question
2. Search PostHog for existing insights using `posthog-entity-search`
3. If insight found, run query and return answer
4. If no insight, check for relevant events using `posthog-event-definitions-list`
5. If events exist, create insight and answer question
6. If no events, search codebase for instrumentation
7. Report answer OR instrumentation gap

**Example Questions:**
- "How many users are using the search feature?"
- "What's our workflow adoption rate by company?"
- "Which companies have declining usage?"
- "What's our time to first workflow?"

**Output Format:**

```markdown
# Question: [Original Question]

**Generated:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Answer

[Direct answer if available]

**Data Source:** [Insight name/ID or newly created]
**Time Range:** [Last 7d, 30d, etc.]

## Supporting Data

| Metric | Value | Trend |
|--------|-------|-------|
| [metric] | [value] | [up/down/flat] |

## Method

1. Searched existing insights: [found/not found]
2. Checked event definitions: [events found]
3. Created new insight: [yes/no, ID if yes]

## Instrumentation Gap (if applicable)

**Issue:** No events found for [feature area]

**Recommendation:**
- Add event `[event_name]` to track [behavior]
- Location: `elephant-ai/web/src/[path]`

**Next Step:** Run `/posthog instrument [feature]` for full plan
````

**Integration with Codebase:**

When events don't exist, search elephant-ai for:

- Existing `posthog.capture()` calls
- `AnalyticsEvent` enum in `web/src/lib/constants.ts`
- `AnalyticsEventName` enum in `functions/src/contexts/infra/analytics/constants.ts`

---

### Mode 8: Instrument-Check (`/posthog instrument-check [feature]`)

Cross-reference PostHog events with codebase instrumentation to find discrepancies.

**Process:**

1. Search PostHog for events matching feature area
2. Search elephant-ai codebase for:
   - `posthog.capture()` calls mentioning feature
   - `AnalyticsEvent` enum entries
   - `AnalyticsEventName` backend entries
3. Compare and identify:
   - Events in code but not in PostHog (dead code or not deployed)

## PostHog Events Found

| Event     | Last 7d Volume | Last Seen |
| --------- | -------------- | --------- |
| `[event]` | [count]        | [date]    |

## Codebase References

### Web (`AnalyticsEvent` enum)

- `FEATURE_ACTION_COMPLETED` → `feature:action_completed`
- Location: `web/src/lib/constants.ts:123`

### Backend (`AnalyticsEventName`)

- `FeatureActionStarted` → `feature:action_started`
- Location: `functions/src/contexts/infra/analytics/constants.ts:45`

### Direct Capture Calls

- `web/src/components/Feature.tsx:78` - `posthog.capture('feature:action_completed', {...})`

## Discrepancies

### Events in Code but Not Seen in PostHog

| Event     | Location      | Possible Reason                        |
| --------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `[event]` | `[file:line]` | Not deployed / dead code / conditional |

### Events in PostHog but Not in Enum

| Event     | Volume  | Recommendation              |
| --------- | ------- | --------------------------- |
| `[event]` | [count] | Add to enum for type safety |

### Missing Workspace Context

| Event     | Issue                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| `[event]` | No `$groups` in capture call |

## Completeness Score

| Aspect               | Status                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Events firing        | ✅ [X/Y events active] |
| Type-safe (in enum)  | ⚠️ [X/Y in enum]       |
| Workspace context    | ❌ [X/Y have groups]   |
| Start/complete pairs | ⚠️ [X/Y have both]     |

## Recommendations

1. **Add to enum:** [events to add]
2. **Add workspace context:** [events missing groups]
3. **Add complementary events:** [start events for existing complete events]

### Mode 11: Aha Moment (`/posthog aha-moment`)

Identify and validate the activation "aha moment" that predicts long-term retention.

**Commands:**

```
/posthog aha-moment              # Show current aha moment status
/posthog aha-moment sales-rep    # Validate aha moment for persona
/posthog aha-moment --discover   # Find candidate aha moments from data
/posthog aha-moment --validate   # Run retention comparison for hypothesis
```

**Process:**

1. Define candidate aha moment (action + frequency + timeframe)
2. Create behavioral cohort of users who hit the aha moment
3. Create comparison cohort of users who didn't
4. Compare 30/60/90-day retention between cohorts
5. If lift >50%, aha moment is validated
6. Document and track

**Candidate Aha Moments to Test:**

| Persona   | Hypothesis                | Events                                   | Timeframe |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Sales Rep | Briefing before meetings  | `briefing:viewed` ≥3                     | 7 days    |
| Manager   | Team dashboard engagement | `dashboard:team_viewed` with ≥5 meetings | 14 days   |
| RevOps    | Workflow success          | `workflows:run_completed` (success) ≥3   | 14 days   |
| CSM       | Renewal intel             | `insight:renewal_viewed` ≥2              | 21 days   |

**Validation Query Pattern:**

```sql
-- Cohort A: Hit aha moment
SELECT DISTINCT user_id
FROM events
WHERE event = 'workflows:run_completed'
  AND properties.success = true
  AND timestamp BETWEEN user_signup AND user_signup + INTERVAL 14 DAY
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3

-- Compare 90-day retention vs users who didn't hit aha moment
```

**Output Format:**

```markdown
# Aha Moment Analysis

**Generated:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Current Hypothesis

**Persona:** RevOps
**Aha Moment:** "1 workflow ran successfully ≥3 times within 14 days of signup"

## Validation Results

| Cohort         | Users | 30d Retention | 60d Retention | 90d Retention |
| -------------- | ----- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Hit Aha Moment | 234   | 78%           | 65%           | 58%           |
| Did NOT Hit    | 1,456 | 34%           | 22%           | 15%           |
| **Lift**       | -     | **+129%**     | **+195%**     | **+287%**     |

## Verdict

✅ **VALIDATED** - Users who hit this aha moment retain 2.9x better at 90 days.

## Implications

1. **Onboarding:** Optimize to get users to 3 successful workflow runs faster
2. **Activation Metric:** Use this as primary activation KPI
3. **At-Risk Signal:** Users at day 10 without 3 runs are at high churn risk

## Time to Aha Moment

| Percentile   | Days to Aha |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| P25          | 3 days      |
| P50 (Median) | 7 days      |
| P75          | 12 days     |

## Next Steps

- [ ] Add "days to aha" to health score
- [ ] Create re-engagement for users at day 10 without aha
- [ ] Test aha moments for other personas

### Status Integration

When `/status [initiative]` runs, include PostHog metrics summary:

```markdown
## PostHog Metrics

| Metric            | Current | Target | Status |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------ | ------ |
| DAU               | 245     | 300    | ⚠️ 82% |
| Funnel Conversion | 34%     | 40%    | ⚠️ 85% |
```

### Validation Integration

`/validate` can check:

- Primary metrics meet targets
- No critical alerts triggered
- Feature flag rollout percentage
