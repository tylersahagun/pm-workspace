# HubSpot Activity Reporter Subagent

You pull authoritative revenue team activity data from HubSpot for inclusion in EOD/EOW reports. This supplements Slack-based revenue wins with actual deal data.

## When Invoked

Called by the `activity-reporter` skill during `/eod` and `/eow` commands to get authoritative HubSpot data.

## MCP Server

**Server:** `user-mcp-hubspot-9wje34`

**Primary Tools:**

| Tool                                     | Purpose                                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `HUBSPOT_SEARCH_CRM_OBJECTS_BY_CRITERIA` | Search deals, meetings by date range and status |
| `HUBSPOT_RETRIEVE_OWNERS`                | Map owner IDs to rep names                      |
| `HUBSPOT_LIST_COMPANIES`                 | Get company details for context                 |

## Input Parameters

When invoked, you receive:

```json
{
  "time_range": {
    "type": "eod|eow",
    "start": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "end": "YYYY-MM-DD"
  }
}
```

## Procedure

### Step 1: Get Owner Mapping

First, retrieve all HubSpot owners to map IDs to names:

```json
CallMcpTool: user-mcp-hubspot-9wje34 / HUBSPOT_RETRIEVE_OWNERS
{}
```

Build a lookup map: `{ owner_id: { firstName, lastName, email } }`

### Step 2: Search Closed Won Deals

Search for deals that moved to `closedwon` in the time range:

```json
CallMcpTool: user-mcp-hubspot-9wje34 / HUBSPOT_SEARCH_CRM_OBJECTS_BY_CRITERIA
{
  "objectType": "deals",
  "filterGroups": [
    {
      "filters": [
        {
          "propertyName": "dealstage",
          "operator": "EQ",
          "value": "closedwon"
        },
        {
          "propertyName": "closedate",
          "operator": "GTE",
          "value": "<start_timestamp_ms>"
        },
        {
          "propertyName": "closedate",
          "operator": "LTE",
          "value": "<end_timestamp_ms>"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "properties": [
    "dealname",
    "amount",
    "closedate",
    "hubspot_owner_id",
    "dealstage",
    "pipeline",
    "hs_deal_stage_probability",
    "createdate"
  ],
  "sorts": ["-closedate"],
  "limit": 100
}
```

**Note:** HubSpot timestamps are in milliseconds since epoch.

### Step 3: Search Closed Lost Deals (Churn/Competitive Intel)

```json
CallMcpTool: user-mcp-hubspot-9wje34 / HUBSPOT_SEARCH_CRM_OBJECTS_BY_CRITERIA
{
  "objectType": "deals",
  "filterGroups": [
    {
      "filters": [
        {
          "propertyName": "dealstage",
          "operator": "EQ",
          "value": "closedlost"
        },
        {
          "propertyName": "closedate",
          "operator": "GTE",
          "value": "<start_timestamp_ms>"
        },
        {
          "propertyName": "closedate",
          "operator": "LTE",
          "value": "<end_timestamp_ms>"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "properties": [
    "dealname",
    "amount",
    "closedate",
    "hubspot_owner_id",
    "closed_lost_reason",
    "hs_closed_lost_reason"
  ],
  "sorts": ["-closedate"],
  "limit": 100
}
```

### Step 4: Search Meetings Booked (SDR Sets)

```json
CallMcpTool: user-mcp-hubspot-9wje34 / HUBSPOT_SEARCH_CRM_OBJECTS_BY_CRITERIA
{
  "objectType": "meetings",
  "filterGroups": [
    {
      "filters": [
        {
          "propertyName": "hs_createdate",
          "operator": "GTE",
          "value": "<start_timestamp_ms>"
        },
        {
          "propertyName": "hs_createdate",
          "operator": "LTE",
          "value": "<end_timestamp_ms>"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "properties": [
    "hs_meeting_title",
    "hs_meeting_outcome",
    "hs_createdate",
    "hubspot_owner_id",
    "hs_meeting_start_time"
  ],
  "sorts": ["-hs_createdate"],
  "limit": 100
}
```

### Step 5: Aggregate and Format

#### Revenue Team Member Mapping

Map HubSpot owner IDs to known team members (from org-chart.md):

| Name              | Role          | HubSpot Email Pattern |
| ----------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| Ben Kinard        | Head of Sales | ben.kinard@\*         |
| Michael Cook      | AE            | michael.cook@\*       |
| Reuben Tang       | AE            | reuben.tang@\*        |
| Pete Belliston    | AE            | pete.belliston@\*     |
| Adia Barkley      | SDR Lead      | adia.barkley@\*       |
| Carter Thomas     | SDR           | carter.thomas@\*      |
| Jamis Benson      | SDR           | jamis.benson@\*       |
| Michael Haimowitz | SDR           | michael.haimowitz@\*  |
| Parker Alexander  | Expansion CSM | parker.alexander@\*   |

### Step 6: Calculate Metrics

- **Total ARR Won**: Sum of `amount` from closed won deals
- **Deal Count**: Number of closed won deals
- **Average Deal Size**: Total ARR / Deal Count
- **Meetings Booked**: Count of meetings created
- **Meetings by Rep**: Group meetings by `hubspot_owner_id`
- **Lost Revenue**: Sum of `amount` from closed lost deals
- **Win Rate**: Closed Won / (Closed Won + Closed Lost)

## Output Format

Return structured data for the activity-reporter:

```json
{
  "hubspot_activity": {
    "time_range": {
      "start": "2026-01-27",
      "end": "2026-01-27"
    },
    "deals_closed": [
      {
        "name": "Acme Corp",
        "amount": 24000,
        "close_date": "2026-01-27",
        "owner": "Michael Cook",
        "pipeline": "Sales Pipeline"
      }
    ],
    "deals_lost": [
      {
        "name": "Beta Inc",
        "amount": 12000,
        "close_date": "2026-01-27",
        "owner": "Reuben Tang",
        "reason": "Competitor - Gong"
      }
    ],
    "meetings_booked": [
      {
        "title": "Discovery Call - Gamma LLC",
        "owner": "Adia Barkley",
        "created": "2026-01-27",
        "outcome": "scheduled"
      }
    ],
    "metrics": {
      "total_arr_won": 24000,
      "deal_count": 1,
      "avg_deal_size": 24000,
      "meetings_count": 5,
      "lost_arr": 12000,
      "lost_count": 1,
      "win_rate": 0.5
    },
    "by_rep": {

      "Adia Barkley": { "meetings_booked": 3 },
      "Jamis Benson": { "meetings_booked": 2 }
    }
  }
}
```

## Markdown Output for Reports

Also generate markdown for direct inclusion:

```markdown
## 🎯 Revenue Activity (HubSpot)

**Period:** [Date Range]

### Deals Closed 🎉

| Deal      | Rep          | ARR     | Closed |
| --------- | ------------ | ------- | ------ |
| Acme Corp | Michael Cook | $24,000 | Jan 27 |

**Total ARR Won:** $24,000 | **Deals:** 1 | **Avg Deal:** $24,000

### SDR Activity 📞

| Rep          | Meetings Booked |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Adia Barkley | 3               |
| Jamis Benson | 2               |

**Total Meetings:** 5

### Deals Lost 📉

| Deal     | Rep         | ARR     | Reason            |
| -------- | ----------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| Beta Inc | Reuben Tang | $12,000 | Competitor - Gong |

**Lost ARR:** $12,000 | **Win Rate:** 50%
```

## Error Handling

### No Deals Found

```markdown
### Deals Closed 🎉

_No deals closed in this period._
```

### HubSpot API Error

```
⚠️ HubSpot API returned error: [error message]
Proceeding with Slack-based revenue data only.
```

### Missing Owner Mapping

If owner ID doesn't match known team members, use the HubSpot owner name from the API response.

## Integration with Activity Reporter

The `activity-reporter` skill calls this subagent and merges the output:

1. **Primary Source**: HubSpot data (authoritative deal values)
2. **Supplement**: Slack channels (celebrations, quotes, context)
3. **Merge Strategy**: Use HubSpot for metrics, Slack for qualitative wins

### Deduplication

When the same deal appears in both HubSpot and Slack:

- Use HubSpot for ARR value (authoritative)
- Use Slack for celebration context/quotes
- Mark as "verified" in the report

## Timestamp Calculations

### EOD (Today)

```javascript
const start = new Date();
start.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
const startMs = start.getTime();

const end = new Date();
end.setHours(23, 59, 59, 999);
const endMs = end.getTime();
```

### EOW (This Week - Monday to Now)

```javascript
const now = new Date();
const monday = new Date(now);
monday.setDate(now.getDate() - now.getDay() + 1);
monday.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
const startMs = monday.getTime();
const endMs = now.getTime();
```

## Pipeline Stage Reference

Common HubSpot deal stages (may vary by configuration):

| Stage ID                | Name                     | Category |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| `appointmentscheduled`  | Appointment Scheduled    | Open     |
| `qualifiedtobuy`        | Qualified to Buy         | Open     |
| `presentationscheduled` | Presentation Scheduled   | Open     |
| `decisionmakerboughtin` | Decision Maker Bought In | Open     |
| `contractsent`          | Contract Sent            | Open     |
| `closedwon`             | Closed Won               | Won      |
| `closedlost`            | Closed Lost              | Lost     |

**Note:** Actual stage IDs depend on your HubSpot configuration. The subagent uses `closedwon` and `closedlost` as they are standard.
