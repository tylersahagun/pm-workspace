# Prototype Builder Skill

Specialized knowledge for building Storybook prototypes that meet human-centric AI design standards.

## When to Use

- Creating new UI prototypes
- Building Storybook stories
- Implementing AI feature states
- Designing interactive user flows

## Design Principles

### Trust Before Automation
- New features start as suggestions, not automations
- Show receipts (evidence) for every AI decision
- Make confidence levels explicit
- Graceful failure > silent failure

### Emotional Design
- **Visceral**: Does it look trustworthy at first glance?
- **Behavioral**: Does it work predictably?
- **Reflective**: Does user feel augmented, not replaced?

### Persona Awareness
- **Reps fear**: Surveillance, replacement, embarrassment
- **Managers fear**: Losing touch, surveillance culture
- **RevOps fear**: Ungovernable AI, lack of auditability

## Creative Exploration (Required)

For each major component, create 2-3 directions:

| Direction | User Control | Trust Required | Best Persona |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| Option A | Maximum | Low | New users, skeptics |
| Option B | Balanced | Medium | Most users |
| Option C | Minimal | High | Power users |

## Required AI States

Every AI feature needs ALL states:

| State | Visual | Copy | Animation |
|-------|--------|------|-----------|
| Loading (short) | Spinner | None | Pulse |
| Loading (long) | Progress | "Analyzing..." | Transitions |
| Success | Check, muted | Affirming | Scale+fade 150ms |
| Error | Warning | Honest + solution | Gentle shake |
| Low Confidence | Muted, dotted | "I think..." | None |
| Empty | Illustration | Encouraging | Fade in |

## Required: Flow Stories

Every prototype MUST include interactive journey stories:

```typescript
export const Flow_HappyPath: Story = {
  render: () => <ComponentJourney scenario="happy" />,
};

export const Flow_ErrorRecovery: Story = {
  render: () => <ComponentJourney scenario="error" />,
};
```

| Prototype Type | Required Flows |
|----------------|----------------|
| Simple feature | 1 (happy path) |
| AI feature | 2 (happy + error) |
| Complex workflow | 3+ |

## Component Structure

Always use versioned folders:

```
prototypes/[Initiative]/
├── index.ts           # Re-exports latest
├── v1/
│   ├── Component.tsx
│   ├── Component.stories.tsx
│   ├── ComponentJourney.tsx
│   └── types.ts
```

## Tech Stack

- React 18 + TypeScript (strict)
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui from `@/components/ui/`

## Storybook Title Pattern

```typescript
const meta = {
  title: 'Prototypes/[Initiative]/v1/[ComponentName]',
  component: ComponentName,
};
```

## Image Generation for Mockups (Cursor 2.4)

When a quick visual is needed before building full components, use image generation:

### When to Generate Images

- **Early concept exploration** - Before committing to code
- **Stakeholder communication** - Quick visuals for feedback
- **Design exploration** - Testing multiple directions rapidly
- **Architecture diagrams** - Visualizing data flows or system design

### How to Use

Describe the mockup in natural language:
```
"Generate an image of a dashboard showing user engagement metrics with a sidebar navigation, using a clean modern design with blue accent colors"
```

### Best Practices

- Reference existing design system colors/patterns in descriptions
- Generated images save to `assets/` by default
- Use for exploration, not final implementation
- Follow up with coded Storybook components for production

### Example Prompts

| Use Case | Prompt Example |
|----------|----------------|
| Dashboard mockup | "A meeting insights dashboard with cards showing action items, sentiment trends, and speaker breakdown" |
| Mobile view | "Mobile-first meeting summary view with collapsible sections and swipe actions" |
| Error state | "Error message UI showing a failed CRM sync with retry option and helpful guidance" |
| Flow diagram | "User flow diagram from meeting recording to CRM update showing each step" |

## Anti-Patterns

🚩 Single option - Always explore 2-3 directions
🚩 Missing states - All AI states required
🚩 States without flows - Always include Flow_* stories
🚩 Confident wrongness - Show uncertainty
🚩 Surveillance vibes - "Helps YOU" not "reports ON you"
