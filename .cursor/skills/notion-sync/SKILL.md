# Notion Sync Skill

Procedural knowledge for synchronizing Notion project data with PM workspace initiatives. Makes initiatives the central hub by pulling from Notion as a source of truth.

## When to Use

- Running `/sync-notion` command
- Running `/sync-dev` for unified dev status
- Creating new initiatives from Notion projects
- Syncing design briefs and engineering specs
- Checking launch dates and ship timelines
- Cross-referencing Linear via Engineering Specs' "Linear Epic" field

## Prerequisites

Requires Notion MCP tools. Two options available:

### Option 1: Dedicated Notion MCP
- `notion-fetch` - Fetch database/page content
- `notion-search` - Search across workspace

### Option 2: Composio MCP (pm-mcp-config)

**Server:** `pm-mcp-config`

The unified Composio MCP provides Notion tools with different naming:
- `NOTION_QUERY_DATABASE` - Query database content
- `NOTION_SEARCH_NOTION_PAGE` - Search across workspace
- `NOTION_FETCH_DATABASE` - Fetch database schema
- `NOTION_RETRIEVE_PAGE` - Get page content
- `NOTION_CREATE_NOTION_PAGE` - Create new pages
- `NOTION_UPDATE_PAGE` - Update pages

**Note:** The `pm-mcp-config` server also provides Slack, Linear, HubSpot, and PostHog tools (700+ total).

## Data Sources

### Notion Databases

| Database          | Collection ID                          | Purpose                  | Key Fields                                                       |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Projects          | `2c0f79b2-c8ac-805c-981b-000b9873980f` | Main execution tracking  | Project name, Phase, Linear Link, Engineering, Design            |
| Engineering Specs | `2c4afb5d-2729-439b-8a07-c2243d7c60a7` | Technical specifications | Spec Name, **Linear Epic**, Complexity, Status, Engineering Lead |
| Design Briefs     | `52148f9a-fe0b-4d8f-a666-e89fc6f3c504` | Design documentation     | Brief Name, **Figma Link**, Status, Design Lead, Due Date        |

| Feedback          | `ca570bc6-30b9-46e9-937e-aa7d72fb5de2` | Customer signals         | Source, Signal Type, Confidence                                  |

### Local Data

- `pm-workspace-docs/initiatives/*/_meta.json` - Initiative metadata with Notion links
- `pm-workspace-docs/signals/` - Processed signals storage
- `pm-workspace-docs/status/` - Status reports

## Initiative Mapping

### Strategy: Notion as Source of Truth

Notion Projects database drives initiative structure. For each Notion project:

1. **Check if local initiative exists** - Match by `notion_project_id` in `_meta.json`
2. **Create initiative if missing** - Generate folder structure, `_meta.json`
3. **Sync metadata** - Update phase, stakeholders, links
4. **Extract Linear connection** - Via Projects DB "Linear Link" OR Engineering Specs "Linear Epic"
5. **Fetch related artifacts** - Design Briefs, Eng Specs, Launch Planning

### \_meta.json Schema for Notion

```json
{
  "name": "Global Chat",
  "slug": "global-chat",
  "phase": "build",
  "notion_project_id": "abc123-...",
  "notion_project_url": "https://www.notion.so/ask-elephant/Global-Chat-abc123",
  "linear_project_id": "05066db9-89d7-432c-bffd-234ca92af024",
  "linear_project_url": "https://linear.app/askelephant/project/global-chat-05066db9",
  "notion_artifacts": {
    "engineering_specs": [
      {
        "id": "spec-id",
        "name": "Chat Architecture Spec",
        "status": "Complete",
        "linear_epic_url": "https://linear.app/askelephant/issue/ASK-1234",
        "complexity": "Large"
      }
    ],
    "design_briefs": [
      {
        "id": "brief-id",
        "name": "Chat UX Brief",
        "status": "In Progress",
        "figma_link": "https://figma.com/...",
        "due_date": "2026-02-01"
      }
    ],
    "launch_planning": [
      {
        "id": "launch-id",
        "name": "Chat v2 Launch",
        "date": "2026-02-15",
        "tier": "P2",
        "status": "Not started"
      }
    ]
  },
  "stakeholders": {
    "engineering": ["person-id-1"],
    "design": ["person-id-2"],
    "sponsors": ["person-id-3"]
  },
  "dev_activity": {
    "last_synced": "2026-01-23T18:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Sync Procedures

### Step 1: Fetch Active Projects

Use `notion-search` with Projects database to get active projects:

```
Query: Projects DB (collection://2c0f79b2-c8ac-805c-981b-000b9873980f)
Filter: Project Phase NOT IN ["Done", "Cancelled", "On Hold"]
```

For each project, extract:

- **Project name** → initiative name
- **Project Phase** → map to lifecycle phase
- **Linear Link** → `linear_project_url` (first Linear connection)
- **Engineering** → engineering stakeholders
- **Design** → design stakeholders
- **Sponsors** → PM/leadership sponsors
- **Feedback** relation → research signals to sync

### Step 2: Fetch Engineering Specs

For each project, fetch related Engineering Specs:

```
Query: Eng Specs DB (collection://2c4afb5d-2729-439b-8a07-c2243d7c60a7)
Filter: Related Project = [project_id]
```

Extract:

- **Spec Name** → artifact name
- **Linear Epic** → **SECONDARY LINEAR CONNECTION** (URL to Linear)
- **Complexity** → effort estimation (Small/Medium/Large/XL)
- **Status** → Not Started/In Progress/Review/Complete
- **Engineering Lead** → assignee

**Key insight**: The `Linear Epic` field in Engineering Specs provides another way to connect to Linear, independent of the Projects DB "Linear Link".

### Step 3: Fetch Design Briefs

For each project, fetch related Design Briefs:

```
Query: Design Briefs DB (collection://52148f9a-fe0b-4d8f-a666-e89fc6f3c504)
Filter: Related Project = [project_id]
```

Extract:

- **Brief Name** → artifact name
- **Figma Link** → design artifact URL
- **Status** → design progress
- **Type** → UI/UX Design, User Research, Prototype, Visual Design, Design System
- **Design Lead** → assignee
- **Due Date** → deadline

### Step 4: Fetch Launch Planning

For each project, fetch related Launch Planning:

```
Query: Launch Planning DB (collection://296f79b2-c8ac-8002-9aae-000bf14c5a26)
Filter: Projects Database = [project_id]
```

Extract:

- **Launch Planning** → launch name
- **Date** → ship/launch date
- **Launch Tier** → P1 (major) to P5 (minor)
- **Status** → Not started/In progress/Done

### Step 5: Map Notion Phase to Initiative Phase

| Notion Phase | Initiative Phase |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| Discovery    | discovery        |
| Definition   | define           |
| Build        | build            |
| Test         | validate         |
| Done         | launch           |
| Cancelled    | cancelled        |
| On Hold      | paused           |

### Step 6: Extract Linear Connections

Two sources for Linear project links:

1. **Projects DB "Linear Link" field** - Direct URL to Linear project
2. **Eng Specs DB "Linear Epic" field** - URL to Linear epic/issue

Extract `linear_project_id` from URL patterns:

- `https://linear.app/askelephant/project/[slug]-[id]` → extract `id`
- `https://linear.app/askelephant/issue/ASK-[num]` → lookup issue → get project

### Step 7: Update or Create Initiative

**If initiative exists** (matched by `notion_project_id`):

```
1. Update phase from Notion
2. Update stakeholders
3. Merge notion_artifacts arrays
4. Update dev_activity.last_synced
```

**If initiative doesn't exist**:

```
1. Create initiative folder: pm-workspace-docs/initiatives/[slug]/
2. Create _meta.json with full schema
3. Create empty research.md, prd.md placeholders
4. Add to sync-queue.md for user confirmation
```

### Step 8: Update Sync Queue (for ambiguous mappings)

When confidence is low or conflicts detected:

```markdown
## New Initiative from Notion

**Notion Project:** "Customer Health Scoring"
**Suggested Slug:** customer-health-scoring
**Phase:** Discovery
**Linear Connection:** Not found (no Linear Link in Notion)

**Action:** [Create initiative] [Map to existing] [Skip]

---

## Multiple Linear Connections Found

**Initiative:** global-chat
**Source 1:** Projects DB "Linear Link" → Global Chat project (05066db9)
**Source 2:** Eng Specs "Linear Epic" → ASK-4500 issue (in different project)

**Action:** [Use Projects DB link] [Use Eng Specs link] [Manual review]
```

## Sync Queue (Needs Attention)

3 items need your input:

- `pm-workspace-docs/sync-queue.md`

---

## Linear Cross-Reference

Projects with Linear connections found via Engineering Specs:

- Global Chat: ASK-4200 (Chat Architecture spec)
- CRM Agent: ASK-4350 (CRM Sync Engine spec)

This provides validation for Linear sync mappings.
```

## Smart Inference Engine

### Mapping Confidence Scoring

| Signal                                          | Confidence Boost |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Exact `notion_project_id` match in `_meta.json` | +100% (definite) |
| Project name matches initiative name            | +60%             |
| Linear Link matches `linear_project_id`         | +80%             |
| Eng Spec Linear Epic in same Linear project     | +70%             |
| Keyword overlap > 50%                           | +40%             |
| Same stakeholders                               | +30%             |

**Thresholds:**

- ≥80%: Auto-map without confirmation
- 60-79%: Auto-map, note in sync report
- <60%: Add to sync-queue.md for user confirmation

### Handling New Notion Projects

When a Notion project has no matching local initiative:

1. **Check existing initiatives** for similar names/keywords
2. **If close match found** (>60% confidence): Suggest mapping in sync-queue
3. **If no match**: Offer to create new initiative

```markdown
## New Notion Project Detected

**Project:** Customer Health Scoring
**Phase:** Discovery
**Engineering:** @Palmer
**Design:** @Adam

**Similar existing initiatives:**

- customer-journey-map (45% match - different focus)

**Recommended action:** Create new initiative "customer-health-scoring"

[Create Initiative] [Map to Existing] [Skip]
```

## Error Handling

### Notion Access Error

```
⚠️ Cannot access Notion database.

Ensure Notion MCP is configured with access to:
- Projects DB (2c0f79b2-c8ac-805c-981b-000b9873980f)
- Engineering Specs DB (2c4afb5d-2729-439b-8a07-c2243d7c60a7)
- Design Briefs DB (52148f9a-fe0b-4d8f-a666-e89fc6f3c504)
- Launch Planning DB (296f79b2-c8ac-8002-9aae-000bf14c5a26)
```

### Missing Related Project Link

```
ℹ️ Engineering Spec "Auth Migration" has no Related Project link.

This spec cannot be automatically mapped to an initiative.
Add a Related Project in Notion or manually link in sync-queue.md.
```

### Conflicting Linear Connections

```
⚠️ Multiple Linear connections found for "Global Chat":

1. Projects DB "Linear Link": https://linear.app/.../project-a
2. Eng Specs "Linear Epic": https://linear.app/.../project-b (different project!)

Added to sync-queue.md for manual resolution.
```

## Integration Points

### With Linear Sync

- Notion "Linear Link" provides primary Linear project mapping
- Eng Specs "Linear Epic" provides secondary validation
- Cross-reference to verify initiative-to-project mappings

### With GitHub Sync

- Extract Linear issue IDs from Eng Specs for PR correlation
- Design Brief Figma links inform prototype tracking

### With Portfolio Status

- Phase from Notion updates initiative lifecycle
- Artifact counts (specs, briefs) inform completeness scoring
- Launch dates inform timeline tracking
