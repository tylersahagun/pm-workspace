# Slack Sync Skill

Procedural knowledge for pulling activity from Slack channels using the `pm-mcp-config` Composio MCP server's Slack tools.

## When to Use

- Running `/eod` or `/eow` commands (as part of activity collection)
- Checking for engineering updates in product channels
- Checking for revenue team wins (deals closed, sets, expansions)
- Monitoring customer success signals (churn alerts, quotes)
- Auditing communication across channels

## MCP Server

**Server:** `pm-mcp-config`

**Note:** This server also provides access to Linear, Notion, HubSpot, and PostHog tools (700+ total). See pm-foundation.mdc for full toolkit reference.

## Fetching Channel History

### Tool Call: SLACK_FETCH_CONVERSATION_HISTORY

```json
{
  "channel": "<CHANNEL_ID>",
  "oldest": "<UNIX_TIMESTAMP>",
  "latest": "<UNIX_TIMESTAMP>",
  "limit": 100
}
```

**Parameters:**

- `channel` (required): Channel ID (e.g., "C1234567890")
- `oldest` (optional): Start of time range (Unix timestamp)
- `latest` (optional): End of time range (Unix timestamp)
- `limit` (optional): Max messages to return (1-1000, default 100)

**Note:** This only returns main channel messages, not thread replies.

### Calculating Timestamps

For EOD (today):

```
oldest = Today midnight (local) → Unix timestamp
latest = Now → Unix timestamp
```

For EOW (this week):

```
oldest = Monday 00:00 (local) → Unix timestamp
latest = Now → Unix timestamp
```

**JavaScript conversion:**

```javascript
// Today midnight
new Date().setHours(0, 0, 0, 0) / 1000;

// This Monday
const now = new Date();
const monday = new Date(now.setDate(now.getDate() - now.getDay() + 1));
monday.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
monday.getTime() / 1000;
```

## Searching Messages

### Tool Call: SLACK_SEARCH_MESSAGES

```json
{
  "query": "\"closed won\" on:2026-01-23 in:#sales-closed-won",
  "sort": "timestamp",
  "sort_dir": "desc",
  "count": 50
}
```

**Query Modifiers:**

- `on:YYYY-MM-DD` - Messages on specific date
- `after:YYYY-MM-DD` - Messages after date
- `before:YYYY-MM-DD` - Messages before date
- `in:#channel-name` - Messages in channel
- `from:@username` - Messages from user
- `has:link` - Messages with links
- `"exact phrase"` - Exact phrase match

**Common Searches:**

| Search For                  | Query                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Today's closed deals        | `in:#sales-closed-won after:2026-01-23` |
| This week's product updates | `in:#product-updates after:2026-01-20`  |
| Churn alerts today          | `in:#churn-alert after:2026-01-23`      |
| Customer quotes this week   | `in:#customer-quotes after:2026-01-20`  |
| SDR sets from specific rep  | `from:@adia "set" in:#team-sales`       |

## Revenue Team Wins Extraction

### Win Types to Track

| Win Type              | Channels to Monitor               | Signal Patterns                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Deals Closed**      | #sales-closed-won                 | Any message (celebration format)     |
| **SDR Sets**          | #team-sales                       | "set", "booked", "demo"              |
| **Partner Additions** | #team-partners, #hubspot-partners | "signed", "new partner"              |
| **Quotes Sent**       | #team-sales, #revenue             | "quote", "proposal sent"             |
| **Expansion Added**   | #expansion-opportunities          | Any message                          |
| **Churn Mitigated**   | #churn-alert                      | "saved", "renewed", "mitigated"      |
| **Customer Wins**     | #customer-quotes, #case-studies   | Positive quotes, case study mentions |

### Extraction Procedure

1. **Fetch #sales-closed-won history** for time range
   - Each message = closed deal
   - Extract: deal name, value (if mentioned), rep name

2. **Search #team-sales** for SDR activity
   - Query: `"set" OR "booked" OR "demo scheduled" after:YYYY-MM-DD in:#team-sales`
   - Extract: meeting count, SDR name

3. **Fetch #expansion-opportunities** for expansions
   - Any message = expansion opportunity
   - Extract: account name, expansion type

4. **Search #churn-alert** for saves
   - Query: `"saved" OR "renewed" OR "mitigated" after:YYYY-MM-DD in:#churn-alert`
   - Extract: account name, save reason

5. **Fetch #team-partners** for new partners
   - Query: `"signed" OR "new partner" OR "onboarded" after:YYYY-MM-DD`

### #sdr-stats Extraction (NEW)

**Channel ID:** `C0A05H709SM`

SDRs post daily activity in this format:

```
MM/DD/YY
Conversations: X
Pitches: X
Meetings Scheduled: X
ICP Held: X
```

**Extraction Procedure:**

1. Fetch channel history: `SLACK_FETCH_CONVERSATION_HISTORY` with channel `C0A05H709SM`
2. Parse each message for the 4 metrics
3. Map user ID to SDR name (from org-chart.md):
   - `U094PHNHCN8` → Jamis Benson
   - `U09S5QQCGS1` → Carter Thomas
   - `U098Q4N5PEJ` → Michael Haimowitz
   - `U07JRK6MGL9` → Adia Barkley (lead)
4. Aggregate per-SDR and team totals
5. Calculate conversion rates

**Output Format:**

```markdown
### 📞 SDR Activity
