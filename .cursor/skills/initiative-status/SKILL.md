# Initiative Status Skill

Procedural knowledge for analyzing initiative status and determining next steps.

## When to Use

- Running `/status [initiative-name]`
- Answering "where are we with [initiative]?"
- Checking if initiative is ready to advance phases
- Identifying blockers or gaps
- Generating status reports

## Data Sources

Load these files for analysis:

```
pm-workspace-docs/initiatives/[name]/
├── _meta.json              # Phase, status, updated_at
├── research.md             # User research
├── prd.md                  # Product requirements
├── design-brief.md         # Design specifications
├── engineering-spec.md     # Technical spec
├── prototype-notes.md      # Prototype documentation
├── gtm-brief.md            # Go-to-market plan
└── jury-evaluations/       # Validation results
```

Also check:
- `pm-workspace-docs/signals/_index.json` - For linked signals
- `pm-workspace-docs/roadmap/roadmap.json` - For roadmap position

## MCP Tools Available (Optional Enhancement)

**Server:** `pm-mcp-config` (Composio)

Use MCP tools to enrich initiative status with live data:

| Source | Tools | Enhancement |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Linear** | `LINEAR_GET_LINEAR_PROJECT`, `LINEAR_SEARCH_ISSUES` | Pull live issue status, assignees, blockers |
| **PostHog** | `POSTHOG_RETRIEVE_PROJECT_INSIGHT_DETAILS` | Pull current success metric values |
| **Notion** | `NOTION_RETRIEVE_PAGE` | Sync with Notion project status |

**When to use:**
- Initiative has `linear_project_id` in `_meta.json` → Query Linear for live dev status
- Initiative has `posthog.dashboard_id` in `_meta.json` → Query PostHog for metrics
- Status conflicts between local and external → Show discrepancy in report

## Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Read Metadata

From `_meta.json`, extract:

```json
{
  "name": "initiative-name",
  "phase": "discovery | define | build | validate | launch",
  "status": "on_track | at_risk | blocked | paused",
  "personas": ["persona-id"],
  "strategic_pillar": "pillar-name",
  "current_version": "v1",
  "updated_at": "ISO8601",
  "created_at": "ISO8601"
}
```

Calculate:
- **Days in phase:** `now - updated_at` (or phase transition date)
- **Total age:** `now - created_at`

### Step 2: Check Artifact Completeness

| Artifact | File | Completeness Criteria |
|----------|------|----------------------|
| Research | `research.md` | Has user quotes, problems identified, personas tagged |
| PRD | `prd.md` | Has outcome chain, success metrics, user stories |
| Design Brief | `design-brief.md` | Has user flows, states, edge cases |
| Engineering Spec | `engineering-spec.md` | Has technical approach, dependencies |
| Prototype | `prototype-notes.md` | Has component list, Chromatic URL, version |
| GTM Brief | `gtm-brief.md` | Has launch plan, success criteria |
| Jury Evaluation | `jury-evaluations/*.md` | Has verdict, pass rate |

**Status Levels:**
- ✅ **Complete** - File exists and meets criteria
- ⚠️ **Incomplete** - File exists but missing key sections
- ❌ **Missing** - File doesn't exist

### Step 3: Evaluate Graduation Criteria

#### Discovery → Define
| Criterion | How to Check |
|-----------|--------------|
| Research exists | `research.md` exists and has content |
| User problems documented | Research has `## User Problems` with quotes |
| Personas identified | `_meta.json.personas` is non-empty |
| 3+ evidence points | Count quotes/data points in research |

#### Define → Build
| Criterion | How to Check |
|-----------|--------------|
| PRD exists and approved | `prd.md` exists, check for approval marker |
| Design brief exists | `design-brief.md` exists |
| Outcome chain defined | PRD has `## Outcome Chain` section |
| Success metrics specified | PRD has `## Success Metrics` with measurable items |

#### Build → Validate
| Criterion | How to Check |
|-----------|--------------|
| Prototype documented | `prototype-notes.md` exists |
| All states implemented | Notes list Loading, Error, Empty, Success states |
| Flow stories complete | Notes mention `Flow_*` stories |
| Chromatic URL present | `_meta.json.chromatic_url` or in prototype-notes |

#### Validate → Launch
| Criterion | How to Check |
|-----------|--------------|
| Jury pass rate ≥70% | Latest jury evaluation verdict |
| Stakeholder approval | Approval marker in docs |
| No P0 blockers | No `P0` or `blocker` tags |
| GTM brief complete | `gtm-brief.md` exists |

### Step 4: Check Linked Signals

From `signals/_index.json`, find signals where `initiative_id` matches:

```json
{
  "signals": [
    {
      "id": "sig-2026-01-20-...",
      "initiative_id": "initiative-name",
      "processed": true,
      "created_at": "ISO8601"
    }
  ]
}
```

Count:
- Total linked signals
- Unprocessed signals (processed: false)
- New since last update (created_at > _meta.updated_at)

### Step 5: Determine Health Status

| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 🟢 **On Track** | All criteria met for current phase, no blockers |
| 🟡 **At Risk** | Missing 1-2 artifacts, or >14 days in phase |
| 🔴 **Blocked** | Missing critical artifacts, or explicit blocker |
| ⏸️ **Paused** | Explicitly paused in _meta.json |

### Step 6: Generate Next Steps

Based on gaps found, suggest in priority order:

| Gap | Suggested Action |
|-----|------------------|
| No research | `/research [name]` - Gather user evidence |
| Research incomplete | Add more user quotes and evidence |
| No PRD | `/pm [name]` - Create requirements |
| PRD incomplete | Fill in missing sections |
| No design brief | `/design [name]` - Create design brief |
| No prototype | `/proto [name]` - Build prototype |
| Prototype incomplete | `/iterate [name]` - Add missing states |
| Ready for validation | `/validate [name]` - Run jury evaluation |
| Jury failed | `/iterate [name]` - Address feedback |
| Ready for launch | `/share` - Create PR for review |

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| [criterion] | ✅ Met / ❌ Not met |

**Ready to advance:** Yes / No - [reason]

## Linked Signals

- **Total:** [N] signals
- **Unprocessed:** [N] signals
- **New since last update:** [N] signals

## Next Steps

1. **[Priority action]** - [why]
2. **[Secondary action]** - [why]

**Suggested command:** `/[command] [name]`
```

## Edge Cases

### Initiative Not Found
```
❌ Initiative "[name]" not found.

Did you mean one of these?
- [similar-name-1]
- [similar-name-2]

Or create new: `/new-initiative [name]`
```

### No _meta.json
```
⚠️ Initiative "[name]" exists but missing _meta.json.

Run `/maintain fix` to generate metadata, or create manually.
```

### Stale Initiative (>30 days no update)
```
⚠️ This initiative hasn't been updated in [N] days.

Options:
- Resume work: [suggested command]
- Pause intentionally: Update _meta.json status to "paused"
- Archive: Move to archived/ folder
```
