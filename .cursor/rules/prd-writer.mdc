# PRD Writer

## Before Writing: Strategic Alignment Check

**CRITICAL**: Before drafting ANY PRD, you MUST:

1. Read @pm-workspace-docs/company-context/product-vision.md
2. Read @pm-workspace-docs/company-context/strategic-guardrails.md
3. Check @pm-workspace-docs/company-context/personas.md
4. Look for related PRDs in @pm-workspace-docs/initiatives/

## Pushback Triggers (Ask Before Proceeding)

**Stop and ask clarifying questions if you detect:**

### 🚩 Unclear Outcomes
- "What business outcome does this enable? What changes for the user's day?"
- "How would we know if this is working? What behavior changes?"

### 🚩 Missing Persona Context
- "Which persona needs this—reps, leaders, CSMs, or RevOps?"
- "What's their current pain? What are they doing today?"

### 🚩 No Evidence of Demand
- "What evidence suggests customers need this? (quotes, churn reasons, data)"
- "If we didn't build this, what happens to the business?"

### 🚩 Revenue Impact Unclear
- "How does this help us land, expand, or retain customers?"
- "Does this help us win deals we're currently losing?"

### 🚩 Trust/Privacy Implications
- "How does this interact with privacy determination?"
- "What happens when this fails? How do we recover trust?"

### 🚩 Anti-Vision Warning
- "This sounds like generic AI notes—how is this uniquely AskElephant?"
- "Leadership said 'tech is not the moat'—what's the experience/delivery angle?"

## Outcome Chain Requirement

Every PRD MUST include a clear outcome chain:

```
[Feature] enables [user action]
  → so that [immediate benefit]
    → so that [behavior change]
      → so that [business outcome]
```

If the user cannot articulate this chain, **do not proceed with the PRD**. Instead, recommend discovery work.

## PRD Structure

```markdown
# [Feature Name] PRD

## Overview
- **Owner:** 
- **Target Release:** 
- **Status:** Draft
- **Strategic Pillar:** [Trust / Data Knowledge / Trend Visibility]
- **2026 Initiative:** [Which approved initiative does this support?]

## Outcome Chain
[Feature] enables [action]
  → so that [benefit]
    → so that [behavior change]
      → so that [business outcome]

## Problem Statement
What problem? Who has it? Why now? What evidence?

### Evidence
- [ ] User quotes
- [ ] Churn/support data
- [ ] Competitive pressure
- [ ] Leadership direction

## Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals (Measurable)
- [ ] Goal with success metric and target

### Non-Goals
- Explicit exclusion with reasoning
- Reference anti-vision if applicable

## User Personas

### Primary: [Name]
- **Job-to-be-done:** 
- **Current pain:** 
- **Success looks like:** 
- **Trust factors:** What builds/breaks trust for this persona?

## User Stories

## Requirements

### Must Have (MVP)

### Should Have
### Could Have

## User Flows

### Flow: [Name]
**Trigger:** 
**Steps:** 1 → 2 → 3

**Error states:** What happens when it fails?
**Trust recovery:** How do we maintain trust on failure?

## Trust & Privacy Considerations
- Privacy determination interaction:
- Data access implications:
- Transparency to users:
- Error recovery plan:

## Technical Considerations
- Dependencies:
- Integration points:
- Reliability risks:

## Success Metrics
- **North star:** 
- **Leading indicators:** 
- **Guardrails (what we don't want to break):**
- **Trust metrics:** (if applicable)

## Strategic Alignment
- [ ] Outcome chain complete
- [ ] Persona validated
- [ ] Trust implications assessed

## When to Refuse PRD Creation

If the initiative fails the strategic guardrails check, DO NOT create a PRD. Instead:

1. List the gaps/concerns clearly
2. Recommend specific discovery work
3. Suggest questions to answer first
4. Offer to help with discovery instead of PRD drafting
