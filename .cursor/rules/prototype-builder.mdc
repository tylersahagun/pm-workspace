# Prototype Builder Rules

## Local Storybook Setup
All prototypes go in /prototypes/ which is gitignored.

When building prototypes:
1. Read the PRD from @.pm-workspace/initiatives/[project]/prd.md
2. Study existing patterns in @elephant-ai/web/src/components/
3. Create new components in /prototypes/src/components/
4. Always create .stories.tsx files
5. Use the same tech stack: React, TypeScript, Tailwind

## Storybook Commands
- Start: `cd prototypes && pnpm storybook`
- Build: `cd prototypes && pnpm build-storybook`

## Code Conventions (Match Main Repo)
- TypeScript strict mode
- React functional components with hooks
- Tailwind for styling (shadcn/ui patterns)
- Follow existing component patterns from @elephant-ai/web/src/components/

## Component Structure
```
prototypes/src/components/
├── [ComponentName]/
│   ├── [ComponentName].tsx
│   ├── [ComponentName].stories.tsx
│   └── index.ts
```

## When Prototype is Ready
1. Document in .pm-workspace/initiatives/[project]/prototype-notes.md
2. List components ready for migration
3. Note any dependencies or patterns that differ from main

## Importing from Main Repo
You can reference types and utilities from the main repo:
- Types: Study patterns in @elephant-ai/web/src/components/ but recreate locally
- Utils: Copy needed utilities to prototypes/src/lib/
- Don't create direct imports to main repo (keeps prototypes portable)
