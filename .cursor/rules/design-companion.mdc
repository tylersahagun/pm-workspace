# Design Companion Rules

When working on design briefs, prototype notes, or Storybook stories, apply human-centric AI design principles.

## Quick Trust Check

Before approving any AI feature design:

- [ ] User understands what AI will do before it acts
- [ ] User can see evidence for AI decisions (receipts)
- [ ] User can easily undo AI actions
- [ ] User can correct AI and see learning
- [ ] AI admits uncertainty appropriately
- [ ] AI failures are graceful and recoverable

## State Design Requirements

Every AI feature needs all of these states designed:

| State | Required Elements |
|-------|------------------|
| **Loading** | Progress indication, "AI is thinking" for screen readers |
| **Success** | Brief confirmation, what happened, undo option |
| **Error** | What went wrong, how to fix, alternative path |
| **Low Confidence** | Muted styling, hedging language, verification prompt |
| **Empty** | Encouraging message, actionable next step |

## Emotional Design Checklist

### Visceral (First Impression)
- Does it look trustworthy and polished?
- Is the AI feature visually distinguished from static content?
- Do animations convey intelligence without feeling gimmicky?

### Behavioral (During Use)
- Is the response time acceptable (faster than manual)?
- Are interactions predictable and consistent?
- Can users easily dismiss or correct AI?

### Reflective (After Use)
- Does the user feel augmented, not replaced?
- Would they tell a colleague about this feature?
- Do they feel more capable, not more dependent?

## Persona Concerns

### Sales Reps Fear
- Replacement ("Will AI take my job?")
- Surveillance ("Is AI tracking my performance?")
- Embarrassment ("Will AI make me look bad?")

**Design Response**: AI helps YOU, doesn't report ON you. Rep gets credit. Suggestions are private until rep acts.

### Sales Managers Fear
- Losing touch with team
- AI replacing judgment on people
- Creating surveillance culture

**Design Response**: AI surfaces insights, manager decides. Coaching, not scoring. Time saved on status → more time on development.

## Accessibility Quick Check

- [ ] All AI features keyboard-accessible
- [ ] Dynamic content uses `aria-live`
- [ ] Color is not sole information carrier
- [ ] Reading level ≤ 8th grade for important info
- [ ] Animation respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- [ ] Alternative text for visual AI elements

## Anti-Patterns to Flag

🚩 **Confident wrongness** - AI asserting incorrect info confidently
🚩 **Unexplained actions** - Taking actions without user understanding
🚩 **Silent failure** - No response or vague deflection
🚩 **Over-automation** - Acting without authorization
🚩 **Creepy personalization** - Using undisclosed data
🚩 **Replacement framing** - Language suggesting AI replaces human value

## Copy Guidelines for AI States

### Loading States
- Short wait: No copy needed, just visual
- Medium wait: "Analyzing your conversation..."
- Long wait: "Processing 45-minute call... this may take a moment"

### Error States
- Be specific: "Couldn't connect to HubSpot" not "Something went wrong"
- Offer action: "Try reconnecting" not just acknowledgment
- Never blame user: "We hit a snag" not "You caused an error"

### Low Confidence
- Hedge appropriately: "I think..." "This might be..." "Consider..."
- Invite verification: "Does this look right?"
- Offer alternatives: "Or did you mean...?"

## Prototype Review Questions

When reviewing Storybook prototypes, ask:

1. **First impression**: Would a user trust this immediately?
2. **Mental model**: Does user understand what AI can/can't do?
3. **Failure path**: What happens when AI is wrong?
4. **Speed**: Is AI faster than the manual alternative?
5. **Receipts**: Can user see WHY AI made this decision?
6. **Control**: Can user easily override or correct?
7. **Accessibility**: Does this work for all users?

## Integration

This rule auto-activates for:
- Design briefs (`**/design-brief.md`)
- Prototype notes (`**/prototype-notes.md`)
- Storybook stories (`**/*.stories.tsx`)

For explicit design review, use the `/design` command.
