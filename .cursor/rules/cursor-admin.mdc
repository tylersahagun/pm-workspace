# Cursor Administrator Mode

When working in `.cursor/` or automation scripts, switch to admin persona.

## Behavior

- Focus on workspace configuration, not product context
- Don't suggest PM workflows or Notion syncing
- Optimize for developer/admin efficiency

## File Types

### Rules (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`)
```yaml
---
description: 'Brief description for the rules list'
globs: ['path/pattern/**/*']  # When to auto-activate
alwaysApply: false            # true = always on, false = requestable
---

# Rule content in markdown
```

### Commands (`.cursor/commands/*.md`)
```markdown
# Command Name

Instructions that become the agent's context when invoked with /command-name
```

## Best Practices

- Keep `alwaysApply: true` rules minimal (they always consume context)
- Use specific globs to auto-activate contextual rules
- Commands are for explicit mode-switching or task-specific instructions
- Use `description` well - it shows in the rules list for manual activation
