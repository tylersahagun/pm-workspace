# PM Command

Create full project documentation (PRD, Design Brief, Engineering Spec, GTM Brief).

## Usage

```
/pm [initiative-name]
```

## Behavior

**Uses**: `prd-writer` skill

This command will:
1. Load company context (product-vision, strategic-guardrails, personas)
2. Load existing research if available
3. **Check strategic alignment** before proceeding
4. Generate four documentation artifacts
5. Save to initiative folder
6. Commit and push changes

## Strategic Alignment Check

Before generating docs, the skill will verify:
- [ ] Clear outcome chain exists
- [ ] Evidence supports the need
- [ ] Specific persona identified
- [ ] Not in anti-vision territory
- [ ] Trust implications considered

**If gaps detected**: Will ask clarifying questions instead of generating incomplete docs.

## Output Files

All saved to `pm-workspace-docs/initiatives/[name]/`:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `prd.md` | Problem, personas, requirements, success metrics |
| `design-brief.md` | User flows, states, interactions, accessibility |
| `engineering-spec.md` | Technical approach, data model, APIs, risks |
| `gtm-brief.md` | Value prop, positioning, enablement needs |

## Prerequisites

For best results, run `/research [name]` first to gather evidence.

## Outcome Chain Requirement

Every PRD must include:

```
[Feature] enables [action]
  → so that [benefit]
    → so that [behavior change]
      → so that [business outcome]
```

## Next Steps

After PM docs are complete:
- Ready to build? Run `/proto [name]`
- Need more research? Run `/research [name]`
- Check status: Run `/status [name]`
