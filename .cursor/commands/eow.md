# End of Week Command

Generate a comprehensive end-of-week activity report with velocity trends, phase transitions, and week-over-week comparisons.

**Applies:** `activity-reporter` skill

## Usage

```
/eow                    # Full end-of-week report
/eow --digest           # Quick "Sunday paper" weekly edition (~2 min read)
/eow --compare          # Include last week comparison with trends
/eow --team [key]       # Focus on specific Linear team (ASK, VAN, CEX, EPD)
/eow --json             # Output JSON format only
/eow --no-save          # Display but don't save to file
```

## Digest Mode

Add `--digest` for a revenue-team friendly weekly summary (no technical jargon, no PR counts):

```
/eow --digest
```

**Output:** `digest-YYYY-WXX.md` (~80 lines vs ~300 for full report)
**Audience:** Revenue team, stakeholders, non-technical readers

| Section            | What's Included           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Week's Headline    | Biggest customer win      |
| Features Shipped   | Grouped by impact area    |
| Bugs Fixed         | Count + categories        |
| Team Contributions | By feature area (by name) |
| What's Coming Next | Upcoming priorities       |
| Week Stats         | Features, bugs fixed      |

**Team Members (use names, not handles):**
Matt Noxon, Jason, Eduardo, Palmer, Kaden, Dylan, Bryan, Adam, Skylar

**Excluded from digest:** PM workspace advances, PR counts, GitHub handles, technical infrastructure

## What It Does

Extends `/eod` with weekly aggregation and trend analysis:

1. **Aggregates Weekly Activity** across all sources:
   - Total PRs merged/opened for the week
   - Total issues progressed/completed
   - All initiatives touched
   - Phase transitions that occurred
   - **Slack revenue signals (deals, sets, expansions)**

2. **Syncs Slack Channels** for week's signals:
   - **#sales-closed-won**: All deals closed this week
   - **#team-sales**: SDR activity and leaderboard
   - **#expansion-opportunities**: Week's expansion wins
   - **#churn-alert**: Churn saves and interventions
   - **#product-updates**: Release announcements

3. **Calculates Velocity Trends**:
   - Week-over-week comparison (↑ up, ↓ down, → stable)
   - Per-initiative velocity (issues started vs completed)
   - Shipping rate (PRs per initiative)
   - **Revenue trends (deals, sets vs last week)**

4. **Tracks Phase Transitions**:
   - Which initiatives advanced phases this week
   - When transitions occurred
   - What enabled advancement

5. **Generates Revenue Team Wins Section**:
   - Deals closed with rep attribution
   - SDR leaderboard (sets by rep)
   - Partner activity (new/onboarding)
   - Expansion & retention metrics

6. **Generates Stakeholder Matrix**:
   - Cumulative involvement needed across initiatives
   - Priority-weighted recommendations
   - Cross-functional dependencies

## Output

### Report Sections

1. **Week Summary** - High-level metrics with trends (including revenue)
2. **🎯 Revenue Team Wins** - Deals, SDR leaderboard, expansions, churn saves
3. **Phase Transitions** - Initiatives that advanced
4. **By Initiative** - Detailed per-initiative breakdown
5. **Velocity by Initiative** - Issues/PRs per initiative
6. **Unlinked Activity** - Work without mapping
7. **Next Week's Focus** - Priority actions for coming week

## Velocity Metrics

### Per-Initiative Velocity

| Metric           | Description                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Issues Started   | New Linear issues created/assigned       |
| Issues Completed | Issues moved to Done state               |
| PRs Merged       | GitHub PRs merged (via ASK-XXXX mapping) |
| Docs Updated     | Changes to initiative docs               |

### Team Velocity (with --team)

| Metric          | Description                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Cycle Progress  | Sprint completion percentage    |
| Issues by State | Todo/In Progress/In Review/Done |
| Contributors    | Unique assignees with activity  |

## Weekly Patterns to Surface

### Positive Signals

- Initiatives advancing phases
- High completion rate (issues completed > started)
- Docs staying in sync with code

### Warning Signals

- Initiatives with code activity but stale docs (>7 days)
- Many issues started, few completed (scope creep)
- Blocked items persisting from previous week

## Integration

### Weekly Routine

```
# Monday morning
/sync-dev            # Refresh all data
/eow --compare       # See last week's results
/status-all          # Check portfolio health

# Friday afternoon
/eod                 # Today's wrap-up
/eow                 # Week summary (to date)
```

### With Status Reports

- `/eow` shows velocity (how fast things move)
- `/status-all` shows completeness (what exists)
- Use both for complete weekly review

## Data Sources

| Source              | Weekly Data                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Slack Revenue**   | Deals, SDR sets, expansions, churn saves (all week) |
| **Slack Engineering** | Release announcements, bug resolutions |
| GitHub elephant-ai  | All PRs merged since Monday         |
| GitHub pm-workspace | All commits since Monday            |
| Linear              | Issue state changes, cycle snapshot |
| Activity History    | Previous week data for comparison   |

**Composio MCP:** Uses `pm-mcp-config` server with `slack-sync` skill (also provides Linear, Notion, HubSpot, PostHog)

## Options Reference

| Option                      | Description                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| (none)                      | Full week report (Monday - now)      |
| `--compare`                 | Add last week comparison with trends |
| `--team ASK\|VAN\|CEX\|EPD` | Filter to specific Linear team       |
| `--json`                    | Output JSON format only              |
| `--no-save`                 | Display but don't save to file       |

## Troubleshooting

### No Previous Week Data

```
ℹ️ No activity history for last week comparison.

First week of tracking - trends will be available next week.
```

### Partial Data

If some sources unavailable (gh CLI, Linear MCP), report generates with available data and notes what's missing.

### Week Boundary

Week starts Monday 00:00 local time. For custom boundaries, use `/eod` with `--since` for specific days.
