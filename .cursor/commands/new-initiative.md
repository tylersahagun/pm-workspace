# New Initiative Setup

Create a complete initiative folder structure for a new feature or project.

## What I'll Create

```
pm-workspace-docs/initiatives/[initiative-name]/
├── prd.md              # Product requirements document
├── prototype-notes.md  # Notes for prototype development
├── research.md         # Related research and findings
└── decisions.md        # Key decisions and rationale
```

## Process

1. Ask for the initiative name and brief description
2. Create the folder structure
3. Generate a starter PRD with placeholders
4. Link to relevant personas from @pm-workspace-docs/company-context/personas.md

## Naming Convention

Use kebab-case for folder names: `fine-grained-access-controls`, `hubspot-sms-integration`

## Next Steps After Creation

Suggest:

- `/pm` to flesh out the PRD
- `/research` to analyze related user feedback
- `/proto` to build prototypes once requirements are clear
