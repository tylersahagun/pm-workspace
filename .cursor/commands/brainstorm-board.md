# Brainstorm Board Generator

Generate visual brainstorming prompts for an initiative. Outputs two prompt styles for manual use in NanoBanana or other image generation tools.

## How to Use

1. Mention the initiative name or provide context
2. Optionally specify which aspect to focus on (research findings, PRD summary, decisions, etc.)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Content

Read the relevant initiative documents:
- `@pm-workspace-docs/initiatives/[name]/research.md` - for raw findings
- `@pm-workspace-docs/initiatives/[name]/prd.md` - for structured requirements

### Step 2: Extract Key Elements

From the documents, extract:

**CORE CONCEPT:**
- The single most important insight or goal
- Should be one sentence, action-oriented

**IDEAS (3-5 items):**
- Core solution components
- Key features/capabilities
- Technical approaches
- Process improvements

**QUESTIONS (6-10 items):**
- Mark resolved questions with ✓
- Mark open questions with ?
- Include both strategic and tactical questions

**METRICS (if applicable):**
- Before → After improvements
- Key success indicators

**NEXT STEPS:**
- 2-3 key action items

### Step 3: Generate Both Prompts

Output BOTH prompts below, filled in with the extracted content. Present them in copy-paste ready format.
