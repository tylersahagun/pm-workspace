# Low-Fidelity Prototype Command

Build quick wireframe prototypes for early exploration.

## Usage

```
/lofi-proto [initiative-name]
```

## Behavior

**Delegates to**: `proto-builder` subagent with lofi flag

Simpler than `/proto` - focuses on layout and flow over polish.

## When to Use

| Use LoFi When | Use Full Proto When |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Early exploration | Ready for validation |
| Testing layouts | Need all states |
| Quick concepts | Need creative options |
| No PRD yet | Have PRD and design brief |

## What You Get

- Basic wireframe layouts
- Key interaction flows
- Placeholder content
- Minimal styling

## What You Don't Get

- All state stories (Loading, Error, etc.)
- Multiple creative options
- Full flow stories
- Chromatic deployment

## Output

```
elephant-ai/web/src/components/prototypes/[Initiative]/
└── lofi/
    ├── [ComponentName].tsx
    └── [ComponentName].stories.tsx
```

## Next Steps

After lofi exploration:
- Ready for full prototype: `/proto [name]`
- Need PRD first: `/pm [name]`
- Need research: `/research [name]`
