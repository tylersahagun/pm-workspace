# Signal Ingest Command

Capture and process signals from various sources into the PM workspace.

## Usage

### Manual Ingest (paste content)
```
/ingest transcript      # Then paste transcript
/ingest ticket          # Then paste ticket content
/ingest issue [linear-id]
/ingest conversation    # Then paste conversation
```

### Automatic Ingest (pull from systems via MCP)
```
/ingest slack [channel] [time-range]   # Pull signals from Slack channel
/ingest linear [project]               # Pull signals from Linear project
/ingest hubspot [deal-id]              # Pull signals from HubSpot deal/company
/ingest all [time-range]               # Pull from all sources (Slack + Linear + HubSpot)
```

### Customer Availability Check
```
/ingest slack #product-updates --customer-check   # Check which features are customer-facing
/ingest all --customer-check                      # Check availability across all sources
```

The `--customer-check` flag cross-references extracted features against PostHog feature flags to determine:
- ✅ **GA** - Safe for customer communication (100% rollout)
- ⚠️ **Partial/EA** - Some customers only (Early Access or partial rollout)
- ❌ **Internal** - Not customer-facing (AskElephant workspace only)

This generates a customer-safe version of the signal with internal features removed.

## Behavior

**Delegates to**: `signals-processor` subagent

The subagent will:

1. Load company context (product-vision, personas)
2. Load existing signals index
3. **For source commands:** Use MCP tools to fetch data from external systems
4. Extract structured information (TL;DR, decisions, action items, problems, quotes)
5. Save to appropriate signals folder
6. Update `signals/_index.json`
7. Match to existing hypotheses
8. Suggest hypothesis creation for new patterns

## Signal Types

## Slack Channel Priorities for Signal Capture

| Priority | Channel(s)           | Signal Types                          |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| High     | #product-forum       | Feature requests, product issues, UX feedback |
| High     | #customer-feedback   | Direct customer quotes, pain points   |
| High     | #churn-alert         | Churn reasons, at-risk accounts       |
| Medium   | #product-issues      | Bug reports with customer impact      |
| Medium   | #product-requests    | Feature requests from sales/CS        |
| Low      | #team-dev            | Technical decisions with product implications |

### Slack Thread Resolution Tracking (REQUIRED)

**Always check threads for resolutions.** When a problem is mentioned, the thread may contain:
- A fix or workaround
- Confirmation that it was resolved
- An update that it's no longer an issue

**Resolution Detection Patterns:**
| Pattern | Resolution Type |
|---------|-----------------|
| "fixed", "resolved", "shipped" | Bug fix deployed |
| "workaround:", "for now you can" | Temporary workaround exists |
| "no longer an issue", "working now" | Self-resolved |
| "ticket created", "filed as ASK-" | Tracked in Linear |
| "PRD created", "added to roadmap" | Prioritized for future |

**Output must include:**
1. `problems_open` - Issues without resolution in thread
2. `problems_resolved` - Issues with confirmed fix
3. `problems_workaround` - Issues with temporary workaround
4. `problems_tracked` - Issues filed as tickets (link to Linear ID)

**Thread Resolution Format:**
```markdown
### Problem: [Description]
- **Status:** 🔴 Open | 🟡 Workaround | 🟢 Resolved | 📋 Tracked
- **Original:** [Quote, timestamp, permalink]
- **Resolution:** [Resolution quote if exists, timestamp]
- **Linear:** [ASK-XXXX if filed]
```

This prevents re-surfacing problems that have already been addressed.

## Linear Signal Types

When pulling from Linear, categorize by label:

| Label Pattern       | Signal Type          |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| `customer-reported` | Customer pain point  |
| `feature-request`   | Feature request      |
| `bug/*`             | Product issue        |
| `area/integrations` | Integration gap      |

### Linear Status Tracking (REQUIRED)

**Always separate issues by status** to show what's fixed vs what needs help:

| Status Category | Linear States | Meaning |
|-----------------|---------------|---------|
| ✅ **Fixed** | Done, Canceled, Duplicate | No longer an issue |
| 🔄 **In Progress** | In Progress, In Code Review, Acceptance Review | Actively being worked |
| 📋 **Outstanding** | Todo, Triage, Backlog | Needs attention |

**Output must include:**
1. `recently_fixed` - Issues marked Done (wins to celebrate)
2. `outstanding_critical` - P1-P2 issues not yet resolved
3. `outstanding_medium` - P3 issues blocking workflows
4. `in_progress` - What's actively being worked
5. `backlog_high_impact` - Known issues that should be prioritized

This enables tracking progress over time and prioritizing what actually needs help.

## HubSpot Signal Types

When pulling from HubSpot, extract:

- **Deal Lost Reasons**: Why we didn't win
- **Churn Reasons**: Why customers left
- **Support Tickets**: Product issues
- **Customer Notes**: Pain points and requests

## Output

Each signal is saved with:

- TL;DR summary
- Key decisions
- Action items (who, what, when)
- Problems with verbatim quotes
- Feature requests
- Personas mentioned
- Strategic alignment assessment
- Hypothesis matches
- **Source permalink** (for Slack, Linear, HubSpot links)

### Required Status Tracking

**For Linear signals:**
- Status breakdown (done, in_progress, todo, triage, backlog)
- `recently_fixed` - Issues that are no longer problems
- `outstanding_critical` - P1-P2 issues needing immediate attention
- `outstanding_medium` - P3 issues blocking workflows
- `in_progress` - What's actively being worked
- `backlog_high_impact` - Known issues to prioritize

**For Slack signals:**
- `problems_open` - Issues without resolution in thread
- `problems_resolved` - Issues with confirmed fix (with resolution details)
- `problems_workaround` - Issues with temporary workaround
- `problems_tracked` - Issues filed in Linear (with Linear ID + status)

This separation ensures we don't re-surface problems that have already been addressed and can celebrate wins.

## Examples

```bash
# Pull all product signals from last week
/ingest slack #product-forum "last 7 days"

# Pull churn signals
/ingest slack #churn-alert today

# Pull customer-reported Linear issues
/ingest linear customer-reported

# Pull everything from today
/ingest all today

# Ingest a specific HubSpot deal's signals
/ingest hubspot deal_123456
```

## Customer Check Behavior (`--customer-check`)

When the `--customer-check` flag is used, the signals-processor applies the `feature-availability` skill:

### Process

1. **Extract feature mentions** from signal content
2. **Query PostHog** for feature flags (project ID: 81505)
3. **Query Early Access** features for linkage
4. **Classify each feature**:
   - GA (100% rollout, no restrictions)
   - Partial/EA (< 100% or Early Access linked)
   - Internal Only (AskElephant workspace restriction)
5. **Generate availability report** appended to signal
6. **Create customer-safe version** with internal features removed

### Output

Adds to signal file:
```markdown
## Feature Availability Check

| Feature | Flag | Status | Customer Visible? |
|---------|------|--------|-------------------|
| Internal Search | `chat-tool-internal-search` | 100% + EA | ✅ Yes |
| Privacy Agent | `privacy-determination-agent` | Internal | ❌ No |

### Customer-Safe Version
[Content with internal features removed]
```

### Use Cases

- **Release notes**: `/ingest slack #product-updates --customer-check`
- **Customer comms**: Validate what to include in newsletters
- **Sales enablement**: Confirm feature availability before demos

### PostHog Integration

Uses MCP tools from `user-mcp-posthog-zps2ir`:
- `POSTHOG_LIST_AND_MANAGE_PROJECT_FEATURE_FLAGS`
- `POSTHOG_LIST_PROJECT_EARLY_ACCESS_FEATURES`

See `.cursor/skills/feature-availability/SKILL.md` for full implementation details.

## Next Steps

After ingesting:

- Add evidence to existing hypothesis: `/hypothesis show [name]`
- Create new hypothesis: `/hypothesis new [name]`
- Find patterns across signals: `/synthesize`
- Link signals to initiatives: Update `_meta.json` with `signals: [...]`
- Check feature availability: `/availability-check [signal-id]`
