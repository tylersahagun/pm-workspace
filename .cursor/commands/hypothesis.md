# Hypothesis Management

Manage problem hypotheses through their lifecycle: active → validated → committed → retired.

## Usage

- `hypothesis new [name]` - Create a new hypothesis
- `hypothesis validate [name]` - Move hypothesis to validated (requires evidence)
- `hypothesis commit [name]` - Commit to roadmap and create initiative
- `hypothesis retire [name]` - Archive hypothesis with reason
- `hypothesis list [status]` - List hypotheses by status
- `hypothesis show [name]` - Show hypothesis details

## Subcommands

### `hypothesis new [name]`

Create a new hypothesis in `hypotheses/active/[name].md`.

**Process:**
1. Ask for problem statement (who, what, when, impact)
2. Ask for initial evidence (signal source, quote)
3. Ask for persona affected
4. Create hypothesis file from template
5. Update `hypotheses/_index.json`
6. Suggest: "Add more evidence, then run `hypothesis validate [name]`"

**Template location:** `pm-workspace-docs/hypotheses/_template.md`

### `hypothesis validate [name]`

Move hypothesis from `active/` to `validated/` after gathering sufficient evidence.

**Validation criteria:**
- [ ] 3+ independent evidence sources
- [ ] Clear persona identification
- [ ] Severity/frequency assessed
- [ ] Outcome chain articulated

**Process:**
1. Read hypothesis from `hypotheses/active/[name].md`
2. Check validation criteria
3. If criteria not met, show what's missing
4. If criteria met:
   - Move file to `hypotheses/validated/[name].md`
   - Update status in file
   - Update `hypotheses/_index.json`
5. Suggest: "Ready to commit? Run `hypothesis commit [name]`"

### `hypothesis commit [name]`

Commit hypothesis to roadmap and create an initiative.

**Process:**
1. Read hypothesis from `hypotheses/validated/[name].md`
2. Move file to `hypotheses/committed/[name].md`
3. Create initiative folder: `pm-workspace-docs/initiatives/[name]/`
4. Create `_meta.json` with:
   - `hypothesis_id`: `hyp-[name]`
   - `phase`: `discovery`
   - `status`: `on_track`
   - `personas`: from hypothesis
   - `pillar`: infer from problem
5. Create `research.md` seeded with hypothesis evidence
6. Update `hypotheses/_index.json`
7. Regenerate roadmap: `python scripts/generate-roadmap.py`
8. Suggest: "Initiative created! Run `/research [name]` to continue discovery"

### `hypothesis retire [name]`

Archive a hypothesis that was invalidated, deprioritized, or completed.

**Process:**
1. Ask for retirement reason:
   - `invalidated` - Evidence contradicted hypothesis
   - `deprioritized` - Not pursuing now
   - `completed` - Initiative shipped
   - `merged` - Combined with another hypothesis
2. Move file to `hypotheses/retired/[name].md`
3. Add retirement reason and date to file
4. Update `hypotheses/_index.json`

### `hypothesis list [status]`

List hypotheses by status.

**Statuses:** `active`, `validated`, `committed`, `retired`, `all`

**Output format:**
```markdown
# Hypotheses: [Status]

| Name | Persona | Evidence | Severity | Age |
|------|---------|----------|----------|-----|
| [name] | [persona] | [count] | [severity] | [days] |
```

### `hypothesis show [name]`

Show full hypothesis details from any status folder.

**Process:**
1. Search all status folders for `[name].md`
2. Display full content
3. Show linked initiative if committed

## File Locations

- Template: `pm-workspace-docs/hypotheses/_template.md`
- Index: `pm-workspace-docs/hypotheses/_index.json`
- Active: `pm-workspace-docs/hypotheses/active/`
- Validated: `pm-workspace-docs/hypotheses/validated/`
- Committed: `pm-workspace-docs/hypotheses/committed/`
- Retired: `pm-workspace-docs/hypotheses/retired/`

## Index Schema

```json

  "hypotheses": [
    {
      "id": "hyp-[name]",
      "name": "Human Readable Name",
      "status": "active|validated|committed|retired",
      "initiative_id": "[name]" // only if committed
