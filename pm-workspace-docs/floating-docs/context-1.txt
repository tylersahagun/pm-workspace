Vision Insights from Leadership Conversations
Core Identity
“This has been the problem that we've been trying to solve the whole time.”1

Source: All Hands (Jan 6, 2026) — Woody Klemetson (CEO)
“Taking unstructured data from one place and giving it to the right person at the right time and the right format.”1

Source: All Hands (Jan 6, 2026) — Woody
“For us to get to…$10 million, $25 million…we’re going to need…a full platform as a revenue outcome system…automate what can be automated, empowering the humans where there’s the human should be empowered.”1

Source: All Hands (Jan 6, 2026) — Woody
Synthesized insight
Leadership frames AskElephant as a revenue outcomes system: we convert conversation + operational context into reliable actions, risk detection, and execution, while explicitly keeping humans at the center (AI “orchestrates outcomes,” it doesn’t replace people).1

What problem we believe we’re uniquely positioned to solve
“Technology is not a moat…It matters about the outcome that what they build delivers.”1

Source: All Hands (Jan 6, 2026) — Woody
“It’s not what you build…It’s how it’s delivered, how it’s used, and how it is experienced.”1

Source: All Hands (Jan 6, 2026) — Woody
Synthesized insight
The “unique” wedge is not “better notes.” It’s: standardized, repeatable execution that improves forecast reliability and customer outcomes—delivered as a system (product + GTM + customer experience).1

“Reason for being” beyond features
“I wanna build an AI that leaves no human behind…”1

Source: All Hands (Jan 6, 2026) — Woody
“If you are not helping orchestrate a human outcome, then you are not working on the right thing.”2

Source: Altitude Training meeting (date not provided in search output) — Woody (quote referenced in synthesis)
Synthesized insight
AskElephant’s purpose is framed as human empowerment via outcome orchestration—AI takes the “legos,” humans focus on judgment, relationships, and the work that actually moves outcomes.12

Strategic Priorities (12–24 months)
Where we’re trying to go
“A full platform as a revenue outcome system…”1

Source: All Hands (Jan 6, 2026) — Woody
Synthesized direction
Leadership is pointing toward an AI-first platform experience (agents + workflows + signals + capture reliability) that can scale to larger org needs without implementation-heavy overhead.1

Strategic Priorities — repeated initiatives called out
From Council/Product leadership meetings, the following were explicitly listed as approved initiatives going into 2026:3

Workflow Builder / AI Assistant Tool (external launch)
Privacy Determination Agent (classify privacy before workflows trigger)
Desktop Recording v2 (reliability fallback vs bots)
Global Chat (AI-first interface; fewer “toggle/settings” paradigms)
CRM Agent upgrades (support current-state workflows while building the future)
What markets/use cases we prioritize
From the leadership framing captured here: revenue teams needing reliable outcomes and teams where execution consistency + trust are required to scale.13 (The synthesis output you asked for does not include a clean, explicit “market segment list,” so this is a partial answer based on available leadership quotes.)

What we’re explicitly NOT building
“Technology is not a moat…”1

Source: All Hands (Jan 6, 2026) — Woody
Interpretation (evidence-based but still inference): Leadership repeatedly distances us from competing on “features for features’ sake” or “note-taker parity,” and instead anchors on outcome delivery + experience.1
(If you want the true “anti-roadmap” list—things leadership said “no” to—I should run a second pass searching specifically for “not building / won’t / say no / never / anti-vision”.)

Product Principles (Extracted)
Outcome-first over output-first
“It matters about the outcome…delivers…”1

Source: All Hands (Jan 6, 2026) — Woody
Human-centered AI (orchestration, not replacement)
“I wanna build an AI that leaves no human behind…”1

Source: All Hands (Jan 6, 2026) — Woody
Deliberate execution over reactive shipping
“We need to learn to…slow down first.”4

Source: Product discipline quote captured in leadership synthesis (conversation name/date not provided in tool output)
AI-first UX (settings become “variable,” configured via chat/intent)
“Your settings are not toggles anymore…It’s a chat…AI first.”4

Success Metrics (Leadership-style)
How do we know if we’re winning?
“50% of our revenue growth this year came from current customers…”1

Source: All Hands (Jan 6, 2026) — Woody
“We added almost a million dollars of ARR in three months…”1

Source: All Hands (Jan 6, 2026) — Robert Henderson
Synthesized insight
Leadership is heavily weighting expansion + compounding growth as proof of value and product-market resonance (land-and-expand as a core validation loop).1

What does “good” look like for users?
A specific “user north star” captured in the synthesis output was framed as a trust outcome:

“Users are so confident that AskElephant is their trusted personal adviser for privacy that they delegate all privacy concerns to the platform.”5

Competitive Positioning
Competitors & differentiation
“Technology is not a moat…”1

Source: All Hands (Jan 6, 2026) — Woody
Synthesized positioning
We differentiate by being an outcome system (repeatability, orchestration, trust) and by competing on delivery + experience + GTM, not on raw LLM/feature parity.1

Moat / defensibility
“The Real Moat…Go-to-Market…Customer Experience…Brand Community.”1

Source: All Hands (Jan 6, 2026) — Woody (as captured in synthesis)
Open Questions (not clearly answered in the extracted output)
What is the explicit anti-vision list (the things we refuse to build) with direct quotes + sources?
Do founders/leaders define a single North Star metric beyond growth/expansion proof points + privacy trust framing?
What is the explicit 12–24 month market segmentation focus (SMB vs mid-market vs enterprise) stated in strategy meetings?
Recommended Updates to product-vision.md
 Add a Core Identity section anchored on “revenue outcome system” + the “right person/time/format” quote1
 Add Human-Centered AI as a first-class principle (“leave no human behind,” “orchestrate human outcomes”)12
 Add Moat & Differentiation explicitly: “tech isn’t the moat; experience + delivery is”1
 Add 2026 initiative stack as “Strategic Bets” (Workflow Builder, Privacy Determination, Desktop Recorder v2, Global Chat, CRM upgrades)3
 Add a Success Proof Loop section: land-and-expand as validation (50% revenue growth from existing customers)1
 Add a Trust North Star subsection using the privacy adviser outcome framing5
Next step (to meet your “direct quotes + exact conversation names/dates” requirement more fully)
The internal search result provided strong quotes, but several quotes are currently missing exact meeting IDs/links in the returned tool output (e.g., “Altitude Training,” some “product discipline” quotes). If you want, I can run a second targeted pass to fetch the exact meeting records (ngmt_*) and produce a fully linkable quote index.
