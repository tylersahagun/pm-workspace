# Amanda Klein

AE Contact: Tony Mickelsen
Company: Matchstic
Email: amanda@matchstic.com
Persona: Celine (https://www.notion.so/Celine-27ff79b2c8ac808d9a00dbc639fde51d?pvs=21)

# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 4, 2025 - Initial discovery call with Matchstic branding agency

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Celine (Customer Success/Client Coordinator) with Odis (Operations) traits

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Strong Celine characteristics - client onboarding specialist, logistics coordinator, relationship facilitator, process-oriented

**Why this classification**:
Amanda identifies explicitly as "the new client coordinator" who supports "all of our client onboarding, everything that we do there." This is quintessential Celine behavior - focused on client experience, smooth handoffs, and relationship management. Her role description perfectly matches Celine's profile: "these early conversations and then, you know, if we get to contracting and handing you off to our project team, I'll I'll spearhead that as well." She remained relatively quiet during the discovery conversation (appropriate for her role), but took ownership of logistics at the end - checking Tony's timezone, scheduling the follow-up meeting, offering to send separate Zoom invites. She shows Odis traits through her operational precision (confirming timezones, managing calendar logistics, ensuring smooth handoffs between Craig's discovery work and the eventual project team).

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns Across Meetings:**

- Process-oriented: Immediately took ownership of scheduling and logistics
- Detail-focused: Verified timezone ("And you're on mountain time. Correct.")
- Client experience emphasis: Offered flexibility on communication ("if you want me to, I can send you a separate invite with the Zoom link. It's up to you")
- Supporting role comfort: Let Craig lead discovery while ensuring operational smoothness
- Relationship facilitator: Positioned herself as the bridge between sales and delivery

**Communication Preferences:**

- Concise and direct: Her introduction was brief and clear
- Action-oriented: Moved quickly from conversation to scheduling
- Accommodating: Gave options rather than dictating process
- Professional warmth: "It's great to meet you" - friendly but businesslike

# Strategic Engagement Playbook (Updated)

**Current Stage**: Active Prospect - Discovery Phase Complete, Moving to Contracting/Onboarding

**What We've Learned Works:**

- Clear communication about next steps and logistics
- Flexibility in communication preferences
- Proactive coordination without being pushy
- Smooth handoff choreography between discovery (Craig) and operations (Amanda)

**What to Avoid:**

- Bypassing Amanda for logistical questions - she owns the process
- Assuming she's just "admin" - she's a strategic role ensuring client experience
- Making scheduling complicated - she values efficiency
- Forgetting timezone considerations (she's East Coast, Tony is Mountain)

**Current Priorities:**

1. Meeting 1 Priority: Ensure smooth scheduling for Thursday follow-up
2. Implicit Priority: Set up for successful contracting and project team handoff if deal moves forward
3. Relationship Priority: Build trust and reliability from first touchpoint

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on aggregate learnings:**

1. **Confirm Thursday meeting attendance**: Make it easy for Amanda to coordinate - send calendar accept promptly, confirm timezone
2. **Loop Amanda on all logistics**: She's the air traffic controller - keep her informed on scheduling changes or additional meeting requests
3. **Respect her role**: Don't treat her as "just scheduling" - she's the relationship owner and will be critical if deal moves forward
4. **Use her as intel source**: If questions arise about Matchstic's process, timeline, or team, Amanda likely has answers
5. **Prepare for contracting**: If Thursday meeting goes well, Amanda will drive next steps - have contract requirements ready

**Watch for:**

- Her involvement level post-Thursday: If she starts pulling in project team members, deal is advancing
- Process questions: She may ask for information needed for contracting/onboarding
- Timeline coordination: She'll likely be thinking about when project team can start if deal closes
- Communication preferences: Pay attention to whether she prefers email, calendar invites, or other tools

# Persona Flexibility Note

Amanda exhibits **Celine (Customer Success/Relationship Management)** as her dominant type - she's explicitly hired to own client onboarding and coordination. However, she shows strong **Odis (Operations)** traits in her attention to process details, timezone management, and systematic approach to scheduling. She's not relationship-building in the warm-and-fuzzy sense; she's relationship-enabling through operational excellence. Approach with respect for her process ownership, provide clear information she needs to do her job well, and recognize that she's a critical influencer on client experience even if not a budget decision-maker.
