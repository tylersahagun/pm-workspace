# Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: November 13, 2025 - Joined Ghaghan's call with Mike Haimowitz. Primarily observer role but asked several technical/product questions. Showed interest in workflow flexibility and change management.

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 62% match with Aaron (AE)

**Secondary Traits**: Shows 25% traits of Irina (Implementation) - focused on technical details and setup

**Classification Rationale**:
Malaika is an SDR at Quizizz with similar pain points to Ghaghan around coaching and feedback. However, her engagement pattern shows more technical curiosity than champion behavior. She asked detailed questions about workflow customization, prompt editing, and CRM integration - showing an implementation/technical validation mindset. As an end user rather than influencer, she's valuable for product feedback but less likely to drive internal adoption.

# Key Quotes Collection

**Technical Questions**:

- "How easy is it to change stuff? Like, I feel like our pitches, like, do we pitch and whatever we come on to on cold calls, they change, like, every week or so because we're experimenting a lot."
- "Can we do our own input? Like, hey. This is what we like. This is what we wanna call, and this is what put in as good."
- "What does it do for the CRM? Like, I read some post. I think it was Seamus or someone. Like, it helps with CRM friendliness."
- "So how do you build that? Like, how does it tell you what is good and what is bad?"

**On Pain Points**:

- "We make, like, 75 to 100 calls a day. You can't get I'll get your feedback on all of them."
- "They're even planning on having our calls being heard. So there's, like, 20 of us and there's one manager."

**Product Understanding**:

- "I think that is what the selling point here because if we were to build something here with an engineering team and the AI team, then I think this process would be longer of changing and all of that because people go on vacation, and then this dude is not there, and then that dude is, like, sick."
- "We forgot this on Outreach. Right? Like, here, we usually just record our meetings with Gaia, and then we got the Outreach AI that basically does the whole question and everything."
