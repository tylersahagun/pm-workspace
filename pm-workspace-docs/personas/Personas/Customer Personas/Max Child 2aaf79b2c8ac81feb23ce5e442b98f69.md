Validation Notes: Max demonstrates strong Revenue Leader (Roger) traits as a Partner Manager who thinks strategically about partnership impact on pipeline and revenue. He has decision-making authority, coordinates cross-functional teams (marketing, product, engineering, legal/finance), and focuses on ROI metrics like "automated gift impact on pipeline." Shows 75% match with Roger persona - the 25% gap is primarily due to his external partnership focus vs. internal operations focus. He operates as a mini-GM for the partnership, making him a strategic revenue driver.
