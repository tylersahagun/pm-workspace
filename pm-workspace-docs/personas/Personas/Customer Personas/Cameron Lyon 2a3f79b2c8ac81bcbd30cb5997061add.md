Validation Notes: Cameron is a revenue leader focused on scaling his pest control business from $677k to significant growth through team expansion. Primary concerns are sales coaching, rep retention, and maintaining quality at scale. Shows strong Roger persona traits (strategic thinking, ROI focus, team development) but operates in a non-traditional field sales environment. Highly qualified prospect with budget authority, though requires Austin's partnership for final decisions. Ready to pilot solution during off-season to prepare for May-August peak season.
Validation Status: ✅ Strong Match (80-100%)
