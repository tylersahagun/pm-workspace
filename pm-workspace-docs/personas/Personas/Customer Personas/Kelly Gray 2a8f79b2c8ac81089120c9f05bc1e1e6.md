Validation Notes: First contact call on 11/11/2025. Kelly Gray is NOT a target persona - she works in revenue accounting and has zero involvement with sales tools, CRM, or client-facing operations. This was a qualification call that quickly identified she's the wrong contact. She declined to provide referrals to appropriate team members. Key learning: T2 Systems uses Salesforce, but need to find contacts in Sales, CS, or RevOps departments.
Validation Status: ❌ Poor Match (<60%)

# Meeting History

- **Meeting 1: November 11, 2025** - Initial outreach call (2 min) - Qualification call that identified Kelly as wrong contact

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 0% match - No applicable persona

**Classification Rationale**:
Kelly Gray does not match any of the AskElephant ICP personas (Aaron/Celine/Irina/Odis/Roger). She is in revenue accounting, which is a finance function focused on revenue recognition and financial reporting, not customer-facing operations or revenue operations. According to AskElephant's ICP, the product is "built for client-facing teams that care about relationships and need to give context during handoffs between Sales, Success, and Service." Kelly explicitly stated she has no involvement with sales tools and is not connected to the sales or CS teams.

**Recommendation**: Do not pursue Kelly as a prospect. Need to identify contacts in Sales, Customer Success, or Revenue Operations at T2 Systems.
