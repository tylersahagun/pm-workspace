# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: January 12, 2025 - Initial partnership exploration call with Pete Belliston

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 85% match with Roger (Revenue Leader)

**Secondary Traits**: Shows 40% traits of Aaron (AE) - partnership sales focus

**Classification Rationale**:
Kathryn demonstrates strong revenue leadership characteristics despite her title suggesting a partnership role. She:

- Operates at ~10 person organization as a strategic decision maker
- Evaluates technology from a go-to-market systems perspective
- Focuses on team enablement and billable hours (revenue focus)
- Makes decisions about partner onboarding and tech stack changes
- Thinks about organizational impact over individual productivity

While she has sales/partnership responsibilities, her approach is distinctly strategic and revenue operations focused, aligning with Roger persona.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Consistent Patterns** (1 meeting so far):

- Asks clarifying questions about implementation complexity ("Do your users need to be technical?")
- Evaluates change management impact ("We probably wouldn't want to immediately change our tech stack")
- Seeks to understand partner program structure before committing
- Delegates technical delivery ("I don't do delivery anymore")

**Initial Assessment**:

- Strategic evaluator who balances opportunity against organizational disruption
- Partnership-minded: immediately sees application for clients
- Team advocate: wants to enable wider team with new tools
- Pragmatic: willing to explore but cautious about tech changes

# Aggregated Insights

**Pain Points** (Frequency):

- Manual work for team (mentioned regarding Salesforce records creation)
- Tech stack complexity and change management (concern about adding another notetaker)
- Team awareness of available solutions (mentioned wanting to introduce new tools regularly)

**Goals Consistency**:

- Primary: Build valuable partnership ecosystem for clients
- Secondary: Increase team efficiency and billable hours
- Tertiary: Enable team with knowledge of emerging tools

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**What Works** (proven in this meeting):

- Product demonstration with real examples
- Addressing integration concerns directly and honestly
- Focusing on team/client value over individual features
- Offering team demo to enable wider buy-in
- Clear partnership economics (15% commission, tiering structure)

**What to Watch**:

- Fathom integration compatibility (key blocker identified)
- Team adoption after demo on January 24th
- Partnership agreement review and questions
