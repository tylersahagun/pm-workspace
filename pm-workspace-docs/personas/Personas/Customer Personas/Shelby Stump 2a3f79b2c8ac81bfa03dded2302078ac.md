"Sometimes my head instantly goes into the how do we build it."

"That is the easiest five k ever." [reaction to workflow reusability concept]

Tools Mentioned: AskElephant, HubSpot, Notion
Traits That Don't Match: • Dual role: Account Manager AND Project Manager (not pure implementation)
• Has sales responsibilities and quota concerns
• More strategic involvement than typical implementation role
• Partner/agency context rather than direct employee
• Manages client relationships beyond just onboarding
Traits That Match: • Implementation-focused mindset - immediately thinks about 'how do we build it'
• Works with multiple clients across industries
• Technical and hands-on with workflows and integrations
• Collaborative communication style
• Building repeatable solutions for scale
Validation Notes: Shelby shows strong implementation characteristics (Irina persona) but operates in a hybrid role that includes account management and business development. She's building AI workflows for clients through Team Prometheus partnership. Key differentiator: she's a partner/agency implementer rather than in-house, which adds sales/business development responsibilities. Her primary value comes from technical implementation but she must also manage client relationships and growth. This is her onboarding phase with AskElephant - building her first templated playbook (AI Sales Playbook with 'Deal Risk' workflow as centerpiece). Currently working through homework to define what workflows to build based on client needs.
Validation Status: ⚠️ Partial Match (60-79%)

# Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: 2025-11-06 - Onboarding: Workflow Builds session with Eli Gomez to develop AI sales playbook strategy

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 75% match with Irina (Implementation)
**Secondary Traits**: Shows 40% traits of Celine (CSM) due to ongoing client relationship management

**Classification Rationale**:
Shelby's primary focus is on building and implementing AI workflows for clients, which strongly aligns with the Implementation persona. However, her dual role as both Account Manager and Project Manager at Team Prometheus creates overlap with CSM responsibilities. She's technical, hands-on, and immediately gravitates toward "how do we build it" thinking. The partner/agency context means she must balance implementation excellence with business development, but her core strength and interest lies in technical execution and creating repeatable solutions.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Consistent Patterns** (from single meeting - to be validated):

- Implementation-first thinking: Immediately jumps to technical solutions
- Self-awareness about role conflicts
- Collaborative and open to guidance
- Energetic despite being "always tired"

**Evolution Observed**:

- Currently: In onboarding phase, building first templated playbook
- Trajectory: Moving toward productized services model with repeatable workflows

# Aggregated Insights

**Pain Points**:

- Time constraints (training for marathon, managing PTO, always tired)
- Role conflict between selling and delivering
- Need for strategic direction on what to build
- Compliance concerns for regulated clients (wealth management)

**Goals Consistency**:

- Primary: Build repeatable AI sales playbooks to scale Team Prometheus offerings
- Secondary: Increase project values ($5k workflows mentioned)
- Emerging: Leverage AskElephant partnership for competitive advantage

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**What Works** (emerging patterns):

- Show ROI and easy implementation paths ("easiest five k ever" response)
- Provide strategic framework, let her handle technical execution
- Acknowledge dual role challenges
- Connect to partner (Brantley) for strategic decisions

**What to Watch**:

- Needs homework follow-through accountability
- Balance between exploration and execution
- Compliance requirements for financial services clients
- Josh may be better strategic partner (Eli noted this)

# Client Context

**Team Prometheus Profile**:

- Type: AI/workflow consultancy partner
- Team: Shelby (AM/PM), Brantley (Sales), others
- Client Industries: Industrial manufacturing, distribution, wealth management, ecommerce, diesel/motor repair
- Service Model: Building custom workflows and implementations for multiple clients
- Tech Stack: HubSpot, Superd, Odoo (for clients), AskElephant

**Current Project**:

- Building "AI Sales Playbook" as onboarding deliverable
- Lead workflow: "Deal Risk Sentinel v3" (monitors sales calls, produces deal probability, competitor mentions, objections, next steps)
- Integration: Workflows push to HubSpot with Superd for deployment
- Target: $5k per workflow implementation
- Vision: Package 4-5 workflows into repeatable playbook

**Ideal Client Profile** (Shelby's clients):

- Behind on technology adoption

- Have sales teams (except ecommerce)
- Industries: manufacturing, distribution, service sectors

# Next Steps & Homework

- Consult with Brantley on what clients would pay more for
- Define complete playbook: what 4-5 workflows should be included
- Potentially pilot with wealth management client (needs SOC 2 compliance info)
- Schedule strategic call with Josh when he returns
