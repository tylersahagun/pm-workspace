Key Quotes: "I'm a client partner nowadays at Ramotion... we're not marketing agency or brand first agency. We're in between kind of merging that gap between brand and product."

"We live in Slack, we tend to communicate a lot, not just once a week, but every day, especially considering time frame. We helped a lot of startup brands that needed stuff yesterday."

"I would say it's a great fit... we've seen tight time frames before. We tend to communicate and share your vision and your goal."

He works in agency sales/account management but is selling TO AskElephant, not buying FROM AskElephant.
