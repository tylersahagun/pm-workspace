**Classification Rationale**:
Eva is a textbook Odis persona - focused on systems, processes, automation, and enabling sales effectiveness through better tools and workflows. Her emphasis on HubSpot optimization, pipeline setup, workflow automation, and data quality align perfectly with operations/RevOps priorities.
