# Validation & Confidence Notes

**Why 78% vs Higher Confidence**:

- Limited participation in business discussion (observer role)
- Need more data on implementation approach and problem-solving style
- Unclear how he handles change management and stakeholder coordination
- Haven't seen him in "technical lead" mode on a project

**What Would Increase Confidence**:

- Observing him in technical discussion or implementation meeting
- Understanding his approach to evaluating new tools
- Seeing how he collaborates with Aaron on technical decisions
- Learning about past implementation successes/challenges

**Alternative Persona Considerations**:

- 40% Odis (Operations) due to hands-on operational management
- 20% Aaron (AE) due to entrepreneurial drive, but lacks sales focus
- Strong Irina fit on technical execution, less clear on strategic implementation approach

**Next Meeting Focus**:

- Watch for technical questions or concerns
- Observe implementation readiness assessment
- Note collaboration dynamic with Aaron
- Assess enthusiasm level for the solution
