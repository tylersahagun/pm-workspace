Validation Notes: Randy is a textbook Roger (Revenue Leader). He's evaluating AskElephant from a strategic, company-wide perspective with clear ROI focus. He's knowledgeable about the competitive landscape (Notion AI, Grok, Claude) and actively comparing value propositions. He values transparency and honest partnership. His decision-making balances team needs (premium users getting value) with budget realities (expanding to non-core teams may not make sense). He's thinking about optimal use cases: keep AskElephant for core revenue teams (SDRs, Sales, Support) while potentially using other tools for non-revenue teams.
Validation Status: Strong Match
