AE Contact: Jamis Benson
Company: SkillsWave
Email: sahil.bahri@skillswave.com

# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 3, 2025 (4:17 PM MST) - Cold outreach call

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Roger (Revenue Leader) with potential Odis (RevOps) traits

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Initial cold call revealed leadership-level authority and strategic thinking about CRM infrastructure decisions

**Why this classification**:
Saleel demonstrated several key Roger characteristics in this brief interaction:

1. Strategic perspective on organizational tools ("we might change the tool")
2. Authority to decline meetings without deferring to others
3. Awareness of broader team dynamics and organizational change
4. Spoke in collective "we" indicating cross-functional decision involvement
5. Efficient, executive-style communication - quick assessment and polite dismissal

While the interaction was brief, the ability to discuss potential CRM changes at an organizational level (rather than feature-level) and reference "team dynamics changing" suggests revenue leadership or senior RevOps responsibility rather than individual contributor roles like AE, Implementation, or CSM.

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns Across Meetings:**

- Direct, time-efficient communication style
- Strategic thinker who considers organizational context
- Comfortable making quick decisions
- Uses collective language ("we") indicating team leadership or cross-functional role

**Communication Preferences (learned over time):**

- Prefers concise, to-the-point conversations
- Values transparency and honesty over prolonged sales pitches
- Not interested in exploratory meetings without clear, immediate relevance

# Strategic Engagement Playbook (Updated)

**Current Stage**: Cold Prospect - Not Currently Engaged

**What We've Learned:**

- SkillsWave is in organizational flux ("dynamics of the team is...changing")
- They're evaluating their CRM tool stack (considering moving away from HubSpot)
- Timing is critical - they are NOT ready for new solutions during this transition period
- Cold outreach without context was ineffective

**What to Avoid (learned from experience):**

- Generic cold calls without understanding their current situation
- Positioning as "HubSpot enhancement" when they may be leaving HubSpot entirely
- Requesting meetings without clear, immediate value proposition relevant to their current priorities
- Interrupting during obvious transition/change management periods

**Current Priorities (inferred):**

1. Managing internal team dynamics during organizational change
2. Evaluating and potentially changing CRM infrastructure
3. Not adding new complexity during transition period

# Key Quotes Across All Meetings

**Meeting 1 (November 3, 2025)**: "We are not thinking about doing anything with HubSpot at the moment. We might change the tool, so not at the moment."

Context: This reveals SkillsWave is reconsidering their entire CRM strategy, not just looking for incremental improvements. The timing is wrong for introducing additional automation layers.

**Meeting 1 (continued)**: "The dynamics of the team is...it's a little changing right now, so I cannot really comment upon it for now."

Context: Organizational change is underway. Decision-making authority may be unclear or in flux. This is a clear signal to wait until stability returns.

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions/Blockers:**

- Current status: Unknown
- Saleel appears to have enough authority to decline meetings but acknowledged limited visibility during transition period
- Team dynamics in flux suggests potential leadership changes or restructuring

**Decision Dynamics:**

- Authority level: Can decline meetings independently; likely has input on tool decisions
- Organizational context: In transition, making new vendor decisions unlikely in near term
- Budget control: Unknown, but not currently allocating resources to new tools

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on aggregate learnings:**

1. **Wait 60-90 days** before re-engaging - respect the transition period mentioned
2. **Research SkillsWave's organizational changes** through LinkedIn, news, or funding announcements to understand the nature of their transition
3. **Monitor for CRM decision signals** - if they announce new CRM selection or complete migration, that's the re-engagement trigger
4. **Reframe value proposition** - When re-engaging, position as "CRM-agnostic" solution that works with whatever platform they choose (Salesforce, HubSpot, or other)
5. **Lead with industry insights or content** rather than sales pitch - provide value before asking for time
6. **Personalized approach** - Reference understanding of their transition and how AskElephant helps during/after CRM migrations

**Watch for:**

- LinkedIn updates about leadership changes, new hires, or organizational announcements at SkillsWave
- News about funding rounds, acquisitions, or major strategic shifts
- Signs of CRM decision completion (job postings for CRM admins, implementation specialists, etc.)
- Engagement with AskElephant content (website visits, content downloads, social media interaction)

**Risk Assessment:**

- High likelihood of continued disinterest if approached too soon
- Potential for relationship damage if we don't respect their stated transition period
- Competition may have better timing or existing relationships during their evaluation

**Opportunity Assessment:**

- CRM transition creates future opportunity - companies often need better data quality and automation after migrations
- Team dynamics change could bring in new decision-makers more open to innovation
- If they're frustrated with HubSpot, they may be more receptive to hearing how AskElephant solves common CRM pain points

# Persona Flexibility Note

Saleel exhibits Roger (Revenue Leader) traits as the dominant type based on strategic thinking and decision authority, but could also have Odis (RevOps) characteristics given the focus on CRM infrastructure. The brief interaction limits full assessment. Future meetings should probe for:

- Exact title and role scope
- Involvement in GTM vs. pure operations
- Team structure and reporting lines
- Day-to-day responsibilities vs. strategic oversight

Approach with Roger-level messaging (strategic, executive, outcome-focused) but be prepared to adjust to Odis tactics (operational efficiency, integration excellence, cross-team enablement) if he shows more hands-on RevOps characteristics.
