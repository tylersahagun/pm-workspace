Key Quotes: "It's like carrying a bag of sand and you kinda keep putting bits of sand into the bag and it gets heavier and heavier... that's kinda how it feels using Gong"

"I use a ton of AI. I was early on creating custom GPTs. Nothing crazy, but pretty fascinated with all that it can do"

"We're in a space where we've really got two competitors. There's three of us. We need to know everything we possibly can in the moment. We're not getting any of that from Gong"

"I still carry bags. I'm running deals. That's what I love to do"
Last Analysis Date: November 14, 2025
Match Confidence: 9000%
Observed Goals: Automate workflows, Build strategic partnerships, Improve efficiency, Scale operations
Observed Pain Points: Competitive differentiation challenges, Repetitive data entry, Time management, Tool sprawl
Persona: Odis (https://www.notion.so/Odis-27ff79b2c8ac8056b9ece0a780fbd900?pvs=21)

Tools Mentioned: Granola
Traits That Don't Match: Uses Granola on top of Gong (signal current tools aren't meeting needs), more concerned about implementation lift than typical Roger, has to 'protect himself' from nerding out on tools
Traits That Match: AI-enthusiast and early adopter, builds custom GPTs, strategic thinker about competitive intelligence, values contextual delivery (Slack over email), willing to invest in becoming AI-first company
Validation Notes: UPDATED Nov 14, 2025 - Intro Call: Confidence increased to 90%. Alex confirmed he oversees entire GTM org (5 people: himself as AE, another AE, 2 SDRs, marketing leader) plus small CS/implementation team. Key differentiation: Very AI-forward mindset, early GPT adopter, uses Granola layered on Gong. Primary pain is 'bag of sand' feeling - Gong has features but accessing them is cumbersome. Critical missing capability: competitive intelligence (has only 2 competitors, needs systematic tracking). Implementation concern addressed by white-glove 3-call setup. Follow-up scheduled Thursday 1:30 PM MT. Pilot approved at $100/seat. Strong buyer signal: First vendor conversation outside Gong, organizing requirements from this call, January renewal deadline.
Validation Status: ✅ Strong Match (80-100%)

# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: October 31, 2025 - Weekly Partner Sync (no direct participation, mentioned by name only)

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Odis (Sales Operations/Enablement) - PRELIMINARY

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: No direct participation, but contextual references suggest sales operations/enablement role

**Why this classification**:
Kevin's classification as Odis is preliminary based on contextual references rather than direct participation. Pete mentioned reaching out to Kevin for setting up training meetings with sales agents: "I reached out to Kevin. They're just slammed, I think, probably." Andrew also referenced Kevin's involvement: "Likewise with me, Pete" when discussing being included in training sessions. This suggests Kevin manages sales team enablement, training schedules, and operational coordination - classic Odis responsibilities. The mention of being "slammed" indicates high operational workload typical of sales ops roles.

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns Across Meetings:**

- Sales enablement focus: Coordinates training for sales agents
- Operational coordinator: Manages scheduling and team resources
- High workload: Referenced as "slammed" - typical of sales ops juggling multiple priorities
- Behind-the-scenes role: Supports sales team without direct customer engagement

**Communication Preferences:**

- **INSUFFICIENT DATA** - Need direct interaction to establish patterns
- Appears to work primarily through email/scheduling coordination (Pete "reached out" to him)

# Strategic Engagement Playbook

**Current Stage**: Operations Coordinator - Enablement Phase

**What We've Learned:**

- **LIMITED DATA FROM MEETING 1**
- Responsible for coordinating sales training sessions
- Currently experiencing high workload ("slammed")
- Key person for scheduling enablement activities
- Works with both sales and account management teams

**What to Avoid:**

- **INSUFFICIENT DATA** - More observation needed
- Likely: Adding to workload without clear value/ROI given current bandwidth constraints

**Current Priorities:**

- **INFERRED**: Sales team enablement and training coordination
- Managing multiple operational initiatives simultaneously
- Supporting sales agents with tools and training

# Key Quotes

**No direct quotes available from Meeting 1**

Referenced by Pete: "I reached out to Kevin. They're just slammed, I think, probably. So we haven't got it set up."
Context: Kevin is the coordinator for sales training but currently at capacity

Referenced by Andrew: "Likewise with me, Pete" (in response to request to be included in meetings Kevin would coordinate)
Context: Multiple stakeholders want to be involved in the training Kevin is organizing

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions/Blockers:**

- Works with: Sales agents, account management (Hema mentioned), Andrew Claus (partnerships)
- Coordinates with: External partners (Pete Belliston at AskElephant)
- Reports to: Unknown - need more data
- Supports: Front-line sales team and customer support

**Decision Dynamics:**

- Authority level: OPERATIONAL - Likely coordinates training but may need approval for broader initiatives
- Key influencers: Unknown at this stage
- Scheduling control: Direct - manages when training and enablement happens

**Team Dynamics:**

- Gatekeeper: Controls access to sales team for training purposes
- Resource manager: Balances team bandwidth with enablement needs
- Cross-functional: Works between sales, partnerships, and customer support
- Currently stretched: High workload limiting immediate availability

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on Meeting 1:**

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Respect Kevin's bandwidth - he's "slammed"
2. **SHORT-TERM**:
    - Follow up on training meeting scheduling when Kevin has capacity
    - Ensure training sessions are high-value and efficient given his workload
3. **ONGOING**:
    - Build relationship with Kevin as key enablement coordinator
    - Understand his priorities and pain points
4. **VALIDATION**: Confirm role, responsibilities, and decision-making authority

**Engagement Strategy:**

- **DEVELOP FURTHER** - Insufficient data to create detailed strategy
- Likely appreciates efficiency and clear ROI on training time
- Respect operational constraints and high workload
- Make enablement sessions valuable and repeatable (so he doesn't have to coordinate frequently)
- Provide self-service materials to reduce coordination burden

**Watch for:**

- **NEED MORE DATA POINTS**
- When workload decreases and Kevin has more capacity
- His priorities for sales team enablement
- Decision-making patterns around training and tools
- Communication style and responsiveness
- What makes him say "yes" to new initiatives

**Critical Gap:**
This profile requires significant development. Kevin had no participation in Meeting 1, making persona classification preliminary. Recommend:

- Direct engagement in next available meeting
- Understand his role, KPIs, and what success looks like for him
- Assess what sales team needs from his perspective
- Confirm if Odis classification is accurate vs. other personas
- Learn what tools/processes he currently manages

# Persona Flexibility Note

**PRELIMINARY CLASSIFICATION - REQUIRES VALIDATION**

Kevin is tentatively classified as Odis (Sales Operations/Enablement) based on limited contextual evidence: coordination of sales training, high operational workload, scheduling authority, and support role for sales team effectiveness. However, this classification needs confirmation through direct interaction. He could potentially exhibit Roger traits if he's more technically focused on sales tools, or Celine traits if he has broader operational leadership responsibilities.

**Action Required**: Prioritize direct engagement with Kevin when his bandwidth allows. Goal is to understand his operational priorities, pain points, and how AskElephant integration training fits into his broader enablement strategy. This will validate persona and enable better coordination.
