# Bass Valmonte

AE Contact: Peter Belliston
Company: WeAssist
Email: bass@weassist.io
Persona: Irina (https://www.notion.so/Irina-27ff79b2c8ac80d6876fef833b5e3799?pvs=21)

Technical Team Member/Recruiter presenting as Irina persona (implementation-focused). Demonstrated technical curiosity and attention to data migration details. Key contribution: Asked critical question about historical data import capability - "Regarding the previously recorded meetings, if we will do some transitions from Fireflies, does your software have this upload capability and then script the data and transcribe it and connect it to the right company and the right individual?" This shows forward-thinking about data integrity and system continuity. Eric identified Bass as someone experiencing Fireflies pain point: "We are also having this issue with Fireflies where it doesn't connect to Zoom meetings. So we have to manually invite Fireflies in order for us to record a specific meeting." Part of recruitment team that will use platform heavily. Detail-oriented implementer who thinks through edge cases before they become problems.

- Forward-thinking about data integrity
- Concern for system continuity
- Detail-oriented approach to migrations
- Thinks through edge cases before they become problems

## Behavioral Insights

- **Thoughtful Contributor**: Less dominant in group settings but asks high-value questions
- **Technical Comprehension**: Understood metadata and data structure challenges
- **Part of Recruitment Team**: Experiencing Fireflies pain points firsthand
- **Validates Technical Decisions**: Supports Eric's technical leadership

## Pain Points

**Confirmed by Eric**: "Bass and others are having this issue with Fireflies where it doesn't connect to Zoom meetings. So we have to manually invite Fireflies in order for us to record a specific meeting."

**Impact**: Manual work, missed recordings, inconsistent documentation

## Role & Use Cases

**Role**: Recruiter on 4-person recruitment team that Eric built n8n automation for. Likely records multiple candidate interviews daily.

**Use Cases**:

- Recruitment discovery calls with candidates
- Technical screening interviews
- Client introduction calls for placements
- Follow-up conversations through 90-day onboarding

## Engagement Strategy

Bass may be quieter but is a thoughtful contributor. Ensure he has:

- ✅ Clear documentation for data migration
- ✅ Training on new system
- ✅ Direct line to technical support for edge cases
- ✅ Validation that his concerns (data integrity, company/contact matching) are addressed

## Next Steps

1. **Include in Recruitment Team Pilot** (Phase 2)
2. **Answer historical data import question** with specific plan and cost estimate
3. **Validate recruitment-specific workflows** are built correctly
4. **Provide migration timeline** with clear milestones

## Watch For

⚠️ Bass may surface additional edge cases during implementation that others miss. His detail-orientation is an asset for QA testing new workflows.

## Persona Note

Pure **Irina (Implementation)** - detail-oriented, technically aware, focused on data integrity and system reliability. Engage with clear documentation, thorough answers to technical questions, and systematic approach to migration.
