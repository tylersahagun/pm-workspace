# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: October 31, 2025 - Onboarding workflow build session (AI education & use case discovery)

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Roger (The Systematic Operator) with Aaron (The Curious Innovator) traits

**Initial Classification**:
Based on first onboarding meeting, Jonah demonstrates clear Roger characteristics as a systems-oriented consultant who immediately translates concepts into workflows, processes, and implementation plans.

**Why this classification**:
Jonah consistently thinks in operational terms - workflows, filters, criteria, dashboards, data hygiene, and automation. When presented with AI concepts, his immediate response is "how do I build this?" rather than "what can this do?" He operates a consulting agency (Creo) focused on RevOps and HubSpot implementations, positioning himself as a systematic operator who scales solutions for clients. However, he shows Aaron traits in his eagerness to experiment with new AI technology, quick adoption of features mid-call, and forward-thinking perspective on AI orchestration vs. basic notetaking.

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns Observed:**

- **Systems-first thinking**: Every AI concept immediately translated to "workflow," "criteria," "filter," or "automation"
- **Implementation focus**: Less interested in theory, highly focused on practical build steps
- **Client leverage mindset**: Using AskElephant both internally AND as client retention/upsell tool
- **ROI consciousness**: Immediately noted consultant increased retainer by $10k example
- **Technical comfort**: Familiar with HubSpot, Apollo, RevOps terminology, workflow building

**Communication Preferences:**

- Direct and practical communication style
- Appreciates detailed technical education (absorbed Josh's AI fundamentals well)
- Quick to test features in real-time ("AskElephant, make a note...")
- Honest about constraints and current limitations
- Casual but professional tone

**Learning Style:**

- Hands-on learner who wants to immediately apply concepts
- Appreciates structured education (responded well to Josh's teaching framework)
- Connects new concepts to existing tools he uses (Apollo, HubSpot)
- Asks clarifying questions to ensure practical understanding

# Strategic Engagement Playbook

**Current Stage**: New customer in onboarding phase (active implementation)

**What Works with Jonah:**

- **Practical use case examples**: Show him exactly how to build solutions
- **ROI-focused conversations**: He responded strongly to the $10k retainer increase example
- **Technical depth**: He can handle and appreciates detailed workflow discussions
- **Client success angle**: Position features as tools he can use to serve clients better
- **Agency multiplication**: Frame everything as "this is how you become the trusted adviser"

**What to Avoid:**

- Theoretical discussions without practical application
- Overly high-level strategic conversations without implementation details
- Assuming he'll figure out the build on his own (he wants guided implementation)

**Current Priorities:**

1. **Building client-facing use cases**: Needs specific workflows he can sell/implement for clients
2. **Differentiation strategy**: Wants to position himself as AI-forward consultant vs. task-taker
3. **Revenue growth**: Two deals in pipeline (ecom.ai + service-based client), focused on retention
4. **Personal capability building**: Learning to use AskElephant effectively before scaling to team

**Deal Intelligence:**

- **ecom.ai prospect**: Pushed to January, larger contract, already has notetaker but wants AI orchestration
- **Service-based client**: Using AskElephant as retention tool, automation + outbound focus
- Partnership mindset: Sees AskElephant as part of his service offering stack (alongside Apollo, HubSpot)

# Key Quotes from Meeting 1

**On internal readiness**: "Internally, we're not big enough to apply all the practical use cases that I want to right now... everything that I need stored, AskElephant is doing it automatically for me already."
Context: Clarifying that his concern wasn't about AskElephant's capability, but about Creo's current team size limiting internal automation needs

**On client value**: "I actually use you guys as a retention tool. Like, when customers are trying to make excuses or lower their contract value... I use AskElephant to retain them."
Context: Demonstrates strategic thinking about using the tool for customer success, not just operations

**Real-time adoption**: "AskElephant, make a note on what Josh just went through regarding percentage fit to ICP. Good use case or no on ice on AskElephant?"
Context: Mid-call experimentation showing quick learning and immediate application

**On AI orchestration understanding**: "We have a notetaker, but we don't have agent AI."
Context: Demonstrates he understands and can articulate the value proposition to prospects

**On implementation capability**: "If I were to do it in AskElephant, I could build a pretty decent workflow that has certain criteria. When criteria's unmet, cuts them out or drops them out of the workflow."
Context: Shows systems thinking and technical capability to envision solutions

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Relationships:**

- **Primary contacts**: Eli Gómez and Josh Daniels (both on call)
- **Rapport level**: Strong - comfortable admitting confusion, asking questions, showing personality
- **Communication dynamic**: Responded well to Josh's teaching style, Eli's check-ins on understanding

**External Relationships (His Clients):**

- Manages mix of ecom and service-based B2B clients
- Partners with Apollo for outbound automation
- Positions himself as strategic adviser focused on RevOps and automation
- Has younger brother (17) - family-oriented, took on guardian role while parents travel

**Decision Dynamics:**

- **Authority level**: Full decision-maker for Creo's tools and client implementations
- **Budget consideration**: Paying for seats, conscious of ROI and value multiplication
- **Buying style**: Practical evaluator - needs to see how to build it before committing to scale

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Immediate Actions for Next Meeting:**

1. **Build session focus**: Jonah's homework is to come with specific client use cases to build next week
2. **Deliver practical playbooks**: Create workflows he can immediately implement for his clients
3. **ROI tracking**: Help him measure and articulate value for his retainer increase justification

**Engagement Strategy:**

1. **Lead with implementation**: Always show "here's how to build it" not just "here's what it can do"
2. **Agency-scale thinking**: Position features as force multipliers for his consulting business
3. **Client success stories**: Share examples of other consultants/agencies winning with AskElephant
4. **Technical enablement**: Give him advanced training on workflow building, agent customization

**Watch for:**

- **Expansion opportunity**: As Creo grows, internal use cases will increase (he acknowledged this)
- **Referral potential**: He's positioned well in RevOps/HubSpot community, could refer other consultants
- **Partnership deepening**: Already using AskElephant in sales conversations with his prospects
- **Product feedback**: As technical user, his workflow suggestions could inform product development

**Risk Mitigation:**

- Ensure onboarding stays practical and hands-on (don't lose him in theory)
- Deliver on "build session" promise next week (he has clear expectations)
- Help him land the two deals in pipeline (his success = our success + case studies)

# Persona Flexibility Note

Jonah is primarily Roger (Systematic Operator) in his day-to-day work - building processes, implementing systems, scaling operations for clients. However, he exhibits Aaron (Curious Innovator) traits when exploring new AI capabilities and experimenting with cutting-edge tools.

**Engagement approach**: Lead with Roger strategies (practical implementation, step-by-step builds, systematic processes) but feed his Aaron tendencies by showing him innovative applications and emerging AI capabilities. He wants to be seen as the innovative consultant in his market, so balance operational excellence with forward-thinking positioning.

**Context switching**:

- When discussing client implementations  Full Roger mode (systems, processes, workflows)
- When exploring new AI features  Aaron emerges (experimentation, innovation, differentiation)
- When talking business growth  Roger with strategic overlay (ROI, scalability, efficiency)
