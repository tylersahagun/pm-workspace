Tools Mentioned: Gong, Salesforce, Slack
Traits That Don't Match: • Very limited participation in the meeting - minimal verbal engagement
• Role definition unclear compared to typical Odis profile
• Less articulate about specific pain points than expected for ops role
Traits That Match: • Operations/RevOps orientation - works alongside Rebekah on operational challenges
• Focus on data quality and process improvement
• Collaborative work style - partners with Rebekah on evaluating solutions
• Phoenix-based (remote work context)
Validation Notes: Trace shows partial alignment (70%) with the Odis (Operations) persona, but limited meeting participation makes definitive classification challenging. He appears to work in a RevOps capacity at Customer.io alongside Rebekah Fellinger.

LIMITED ENGAGEMENT CONTEXT:
- Only had one brief speaking moment in the 32-minute call
- Comment about Gong limitations suggests hands-on tool usage
- Location in Phoenix noted at meeting start
- Rebekah clearly leads the conversation and evaluation

INFERRED ROLE CHARACTERISTICS:
• Likely supports Rebekah in RevOps/BDR operations capacity
• May be more technical/analytical vs. managerial
• Appears to be involved in tool evaluation process
• Uses Gong regularly based on specific limitation knowledge

PERSONA CONFIDENCE RATIONALE:
Lower confidence (70%) due to:
- Minimal verbal participation limits behavioral analysis
- Unclear decision-making authority relative to Rebekah
- Cannot assess communication patterns or strategic thinking from limited input
- Role responsibilities not explicitly discussed

RECOMMENDATION FOR FUTURE ENGAGEMENT:
- Direct questions to Trace in follow-up meetings to assess role more accurately
- Understand his specific responsibilities vs. Rebekah's
- Determine if he's technical lead, analyst, or operational support
- May need to reclassify persona after more engagement data

WORKING HYPOTHESIS:
Likely an Operations Analyst or RevOps Coordinator who:
- Supports Rebekah's BDR operations initiatives
- Handles technical tool evaluation and data analysis
- Less customer-facing than Rebekah
- More execution-oriented than decision-making oriented
Validation Status: ⚠️ Partial Match (60-79%)
