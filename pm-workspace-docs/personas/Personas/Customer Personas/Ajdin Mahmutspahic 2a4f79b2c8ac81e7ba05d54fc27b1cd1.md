Validation Notes: **Meeting Context**: Reconnection call after ~1 year since initial demo. Previous engagement focused on L&D/coaching; current focus on agentic AI for sales enablement.

**Primary Persona Match: Odis (Operations) - 78% confidence**
Ajdin demonstrates strong Operations/RevOps characteristics through his focus on cross-functional process automation, tool evaluation, and reducing administrative overhead. His role coordinating 'AI advocates' across business units and evaluating solutions for enterprise-wide impact aligns with RevOps mandate.

**Secondary Traits: Irina (Implementation) - ~30%**
Shows implementation/change management traits through facilitator role and stakeholder coordination, but this appears secondary to evaluation function.

**Decision-Making Context**:
- Reports to Junaid (primary decision maker)
- Influencer/Champion role in evaluation process
- Will coordinate group demo with AI advocates from each business area
- Timeline: Early 2026 due to Lexmark acquisition transition

**Technical Sophistication**: High
- Asked about LLM models (ChatGPT vs Microsoft)
- Understands agent orchestration concepts
- Knows specific integration requirements (D365, Genesys, Teams, Salesforce)

**Buying Stage**: Early discovery/ideation
**Competition**: Gong mentioned as alternative being considered

**Engagement Strategy**:
- Provide use case examples and educational content
- Position for group demo with distributed stakeholders
- Emphasize cross-departmental capabilities vs point solutions
- Address enterprise integration requirements
- Patient approach given acquisition timing
