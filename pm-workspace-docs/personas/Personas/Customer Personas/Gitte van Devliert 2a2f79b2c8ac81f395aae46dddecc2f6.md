Validation Notes: Gitte demonstrates strong CSM characteristics with a unique twist - she's building AI automation playbooks for WX Agency's clients rather than using them directly for her own customer success role. She shows 75% match with Celine (CSM) persona due to her focus on handoffs, context preservation, and proactive account management. However, she exhibits higher technical proficiency and strategic thinking about AI implementation than typical CSMs. Her agency/partner context makes her a hybrid between implementer and CSM.

Key behavioral patterns:
- Homework completer: Built multiple workflows between sessions
- Iterative thinker: Tests, refines, and optimizes solutions
- Strategic packager: Thinking about templated, scalable playbooks
- Customer outcome-focused: Building what clients need, not just what's technically possible

This is her second onboarding session with AskElephant, showing progressive engagement and increasing sophistication in workflow building.
Validation Status: ⚠️ Partial Match (60-79%)
