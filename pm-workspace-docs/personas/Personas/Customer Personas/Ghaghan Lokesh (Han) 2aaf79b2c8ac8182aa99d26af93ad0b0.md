Tools Mentioned: Gmail, Outreach, Salesforce, Slack
Traits That Don't Match: • SDR role vs AE persona (earlier in sales cycle)
• Not directly closing deals or owning ARR
• Less decision-making authority (needs manager approval)
• Focus on outbound activity vs deal management
• India-based team calling US schools (unique context)
Traits That Match: • Quota-driven mindset (team working on 200 meeting sprint)

• Willing to champion solutions internally
Validation Notes: Ghaghan is an SDR at Quizizz, part of a large India-based team calling US schools. While his role differs from the Aaron (AE) persona, his pain points around coaching, performance optimization, and quota attainment show strong alignment. He demonstrates champion characteristics - willing to advocate internally, connected his colleague Malaika to the call, and committed to posting on LinkedIn and sharing with his Sales 1-1 community. His manager Vishnu is the actual decision-maker. Key differentiator: struggles with language/terminology adaptation for US market.
Validation Status: Partial Match

# Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: November 13, 2025 - Initial discovery call with Mike Haimowitz, brought colleague Malaika

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 65% match with Aaron (AE)

**Secondary Traits**: Shows 30% traits of Roger (Revenue Leader) in terms of strategic thinking about team needs

**Classification Rationale**:
While Ghaghan is an SDR rather than an AE, his pain points and motivations align most closely with Aaron's persona. He's focused on hitting quota (team sprint of 200 meetings in 10 weeks), improving performance through better coaching/tools, and demonstrating strong tech adoption mindset. The key difference is his position in the sales cycle (prospecting vs closing) and level of authority (influencer vs decision maker). However, his champion characteristics make him valuable for AskElephant's multi-threaded approach.
