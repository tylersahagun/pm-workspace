# Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: November 6, 2025 - AskElephant Demo | Initial discovery of Camp Spot's needs for scalable coaching and CRM automation

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 85% match with Roger (Revenue Leader)
**Secondary Traits**: Shows 40% traits of Aaron (AE) due to player-coach model

**Classification Rationale**:
Jeff maps strongly to Roger persona as a VP of Sales building outbound infrastructure at scale. His focus on team coaching, process automation, and data-driven decisions aligns with revenue leadership priorities. However, his unique "player-coach" model carrying individual quota creates hybrid characteristics more typical of AE personas. The match is strong on strategic priorities (scaling, coaching systems, efficiency) while diverging on execution level (more hands-on than typical revenue leaders).

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Consistent Patterns** (Single meeting baseline - watch for confirmation):

- Seeks automation to remove administrative burden from reps
- Values hands-on coaching but recognizes scalability limits
- Adopts collaborative decision-making approach (involves Gabby, needs multiple buy-ins)
- Self-aware about bandwidth constraints and implementation gaps
- Open about challenges and limitations ("sales guy, easiest person to sell")

**Initial Profile Observations**:

- Currently: Building outbound engine while managing existing business
- Stage: Early adoption of sales intelligence tools (Attention user seeking better solution)
- Decision Style: Consensus-based, involves CS leadership (Gabby) in tool decisions

# Aggregated Insights

**Pain Points** (Priority ranked by emphasis):

1. **Scaling coaching** - "Really difficult to scale at speed" - Primary driver
2. **Time constraints** - Player-coach model limits bandwidth for implementation
3. **Tool limitations** - Attention not delivering on promised functionality
4. **Manual CRM updates** - "Any updates you can be making to the CRM that the AE doesn't have to make"
5. **Call analysis efficiency** - Currently manually reviewing 2+ minute calls
6. **Adoption challenges** - "Old dog new tricks situation... need to be handheld"

**Goals Consistency**:

- **Primary**: Build scalable coaching systems to replicate his hands-on approach
- **Secondary**: Automate CRM workflows to increase rep selling time
- **Emerging**: Create self-reflection capabilities for rep autonomy

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**What Works** (proven in this meeting):

- Acknowledge the "player-coach" challenge directly - he resonates with being understood
- Lead with coaching automation and scalability solutions
- Demonstrate white-glove implementation approach (he needs handholding)
- Involve Gabby (CS leader) early - he values collaborative decisions
- Offer competitive analysis vs Attention with concrete use cases
- Reference similar customer transformations (gifting company example landed well)
- Price flexibility with partner referral discount shows partnership approach

**What Doesn't** (potential pitfalls):

- Don't assume he has bandwidth for self-service setup
- Avoid complex technical jargon - he's strategic not deeply technical
- Don't rush decision timeline - he's traveling, rebuilding sales process
- Don't bypass Gabby - she has equal influence on tool decisions
- Avoid overwhelming with features - focus on core coaching + CRM automation

**Critical Next Steps Identified**:

1. Josh sends recap email with competitive analysis + case studies (tonight)
2. Zoya discusses with Gabby (CS leader) to get her buy-in
3. Reconnect after OHCE conference (post-November 13)
4. Potential demo with Gabby before presenting to Michael (final approver)
