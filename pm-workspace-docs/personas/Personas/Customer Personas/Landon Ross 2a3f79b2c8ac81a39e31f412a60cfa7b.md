Key Quotes: "I think oftentimes, I don't know the meeting that I'm necessarily or I am looking for trends across a 100 meetings or so. You know? Like, this is when I'm going to coach or if we're looking at insights across, like, how reps are doing, etcetera. But it seems to overload the chat piece."

"I want trends. I wanna see what's working, what's not working... if I can, like, just from the rooftops, like, please put this at the top of the product."

"I'm happy to put you know, like, I will go and poke around and and I can I'm comfortable building workflows. I just yeah. I would love what I'm hearing is that I build a workflow today, and then I can basically expect by, like, maybe November... going into December that's when I can actually start to see."

"I want aggregated insights, you know, I think would would be most helpful to me."
