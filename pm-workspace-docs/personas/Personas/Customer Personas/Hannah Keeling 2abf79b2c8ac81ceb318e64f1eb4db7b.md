Tools Mentioned: AskElephant, ChatGPT, Google Drive, Zoom
Traits That Don't Match: Doesn't fit typical sales/CS/implementation roles
More specialized consultant/strategist role
Creates intellectual property rather than executes processes
Traits That Match: Strategic thinker - develops SEO and client strategies
Knowledge worker - brain-driven work that's hard to capture
Time-constrained - has "a million things going on"
Quality-focused - AI outputs are "base" but she adds strategic value
Validation Notes: Hannah doesn't fit cleanly into standard B2B SaaS personas. She's a specialized strategist/consultant who creates custom strategies for clients based on deep expertise. Her pain points relate to capturing her tacit knowledge and making it accessible to the team. The team recognizes her brain as a valuable asset they want to scale. This represents a persona gap - potentially "Strategic Consultant" or "Subject Matter Expert" persona.
