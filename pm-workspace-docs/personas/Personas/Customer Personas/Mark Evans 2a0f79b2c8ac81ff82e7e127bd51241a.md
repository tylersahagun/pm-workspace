# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 3, 2025 - Weekly AskE x Motivosity Sync (present but did not speak)

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Celine (The Implementer)

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Identified as Celine based on contextual references to his hands-on workflow creation activities

**Why this classification**:
While Mark did not speak during this meeting, Parker referenced his direct involvement in workflow creation from their Thursday session: "Mark did his that we kinda went over, and then we did the one for the business needs assessment." This indicates Mark is hands-on with the product, personally building and configuring workflows rather than delegating to others. This active, tactical involvement in product configuration is a clear Celine trait. He's working alongside Tom Morrell (another Celine) on implementation details.

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns Across Meetings:**

- Hands-on with product configuration and workflow creation
- Participates in technical implementation sessions
- Works collaboratively with team on workflow development
- Attends regular sync meetings even when not actively speaking

**Communication Preferences:**

- Present and engaged even when not verbally participating
- Prefers to learn by doing (builds workflows himself)
- Likely processes information by listening and then implementing

# Strategic Engagement Playbook

**Current Stage**: Established Customer - Implementation/Optimization Phase

**What We've Learned Works:**

- Provide hands-on workflow building opportunities
- Include him in technical implementation sessions
- Give him the tools and access to build/configure himself

**Current Priorities:**

1. **Workflow Development**: Actively creating and testing workflows
2. **Business Needs Assessment**: Built workflow for this use case
3. **Product Learning**: Developing hands-on expertise through direct usage

# Key Quotes Across All Meetings

**Meeting 1**: [No direct quotes - did not speak in this meeting]
Context: His participation was referenced by Parker regarding previous workflow creation session on Thursday.

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions/Blockers:**

- Works closely with: Tom Morrell (fellow implementer/operator)
- Collaborates with: Christopher Wood (team member)
- External relationship: Parker Alexander (AskElephant AE)

**Decision Dynamics:**

- Authority level: Operational - likely individual contributor or team lead level
- Role: Hands-on product user and workflow builder
- Implementation involvement: High - directly builds and configures

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on aggregate learnings:**

1. **Continue Workflow Training**: Mark is learning by doing. Provide additional workflow templates and examples he can modify.
2. **Gather His Feedback**: Even though he's quiet in meetings, his hands-on product usage means he has valuable insights. Consider asking Tom to gather Mark's feedback on workflow usability.
3. **Documentation**: Ensure Mark has access to workflow documentation and best practices since he's actively building.

**Watch for:**

- His actual workflow usage patterns may reveal more specific needs and pain points
- He may prefer asynchronous communication or documentation over live discussion
- His quiet participation style doesn't mean disengagement - he's learning and implementing

# Persona Flexibility Note

Mark appears to be a Celine persona based on his hands-on, tactical approach to workflow creation. However, we have limited data from this first meeting since he did not speak. Future meetings will help confirm this assessment and identify any secondary persona traits. His communication style (present but quiet) may indicate he's more comfortable with doing than discussing, which would further confirm the Celine classification.

**Data Confidence Level**: Medium - Need more meeting observations to fully confirm persona and engagement patterns.
