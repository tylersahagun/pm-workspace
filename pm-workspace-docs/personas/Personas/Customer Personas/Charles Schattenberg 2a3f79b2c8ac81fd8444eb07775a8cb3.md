Key Quotes: "We franchised our business, and we're adding franchises about one a month. So we are really, really growing."

"I pulled a list of every meeting that's happened year to date, and we're at 1,400 meetings year to date... unless you're on top of that, like, did the meeting happen? What is the status of it? What type of meeting was it? All of that is cumbersome for us to try to clean up and stay on top of."

"One of the value adds for this is, yes, cleaning up data, cleaning up the pipeline for our sales reps and our franchisees. It's also we're trying to eliminate some of that administrative burden." [Cole speaking for Charles's priorities]

Tools Mentioned: HubSpot, Kixie, Microsoft Outlook, Zoom
Traits That Don't Match: • More hands-on operationally than typical C-suite Roger
• Directly involved in CRM configuration and system details
• Shows some Operations (Odis) tendencies with process concerns
Traits That Match: • Strategic thinker focused on scaling operations (franchising 1/month)
• Data-driven decision maker (1,400 meetings YTD tracked)
• Revenue operations mindset - pipeline management & analytics focus
• Growth-oriented leader managing rapid expansion
• Concerned with team efficiency and administrative burden
• Evaluates technology for competitive advantage
• Delegates but stays involved in technology decisions
Validation Notes: Charles is a strong match for Roger persona (Revenue Leader) at 85% confidence. He demonstrates clear strategic leadership of a rapidly scaling PEO brokerage firm, with responsibility for revenue operations, CRM strategy, and franchise expansion. 

Key indicators: Leading franchise growth (1/month), managing 1,400+ meetings annually, overseeing sales team with SDRs and admins, evaluating AI technology for competitive advantage, focused on pipeline management and data analytics.

The 15% gap comes from his hands-on involvement in operational details (CRM fields, workflow configuration) which shows some Odis (Operations) characteristics. However, his primary concern is strategic scaling and revenue growth, not day-to-day operations execution.

Decision-making authority: Clear decision maker, brought team member (Cole) to evaluate, scheduled follow-up demo, and discussed pricing/implementation timelines.
Validation Status: ✅ Strong Match (80-100%)

# Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: November 6, 2025 - Initial discovery call (AskElephant: Intro Call)
    - Context: Referred by Kixie partnership, exploring CRM hygiene and AI automation solutions
    - Duration: ~35 minutes
    - Attendees: Charles Schattenberg, Cole (sales rep), Mike Canova

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 85% match with Roger (Revenue Leader)
**Secondary Traits**: Shows 25% traits of Odis (Operations) - operational detail orientation

**Classification Rationale**:
Charles firmly sits in the Roger persona as a revenue leader managing rapid business scaling through franchising. His focus on CRM hygiene, data quality, and pipeline management stems from strategic growth needs, not operational execution. Key evidence:

- Leading franchise expansion (1/month growth rate)
- Oversight of 1,400+ annual meetings across sales team
- Evaluating technology for competitive advantage and team efficiency
- Making purchasing decisions with implementation timeline discussions
- Brought team member to evaluate solution fit

The operational detail questions (CRM fields, workflows) are typical for a strategic leader doing due diligence, not an operations person executing day-to-day tasks.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Communication Approach**:

- Strategic and efficient communicator
- Appreciates quick availability (same-day scheduling)
- Balances big-picture thinking with tactical questions
- Collaborative - brings team members into evaluation
- Direct about constraints (time-pressed, "back to back to back day")

**Decision-Making Style**:

- Thorough but action-oriented
- Wants to see systems in context (requested screen share for next meeting)
- Prepares structured pain points list before deeper evaluation
- Values partner referrals (Kixie recommendation carried weight)
- Willing to invest time when value is clear (scheduled 1-hour follow-up)

# Aggregated Insights

**Pain Points (Priority Order)**:

1. **Manual CRM data management** - 1,400 meetings/year, cumbersome tracking
2. **Data hygiene/quality** - Meeting types, status, lead source attribution
3. **Administrative burden** - Multi-touch deals, document collection, underwriting
4. **Team scaling challenges** - Franchise model requires repeatable processes
5. **Time management** - Back-to-back schedule, needs efficiency gains

**Goals Consistency**:

- **Primary**: Scale operations efficiently through AI/automation as franchises grow
- **Secondary**: Improve CRM data quality for better analytics and decision-making
- **Tertiary**: Reduce administrative burden on sales team and franchisees
- **Emerging**: Integrate custom quoting software with CRM ecosystem

**Technology Stack**:

- **CRM**: HubSpot (main system, built from ground up over 6-8 months)
- **Dialer**: Kixie (integrated with HubSpot)
- **Meetings**: Zoom Enterprise (with Zoom AI)
- **Email/Calendar**: Microsoft Outlook
- **Custom**: Proprietary quoting software (in development)

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**What Works** (proven in this meeting):

- Immediate availability creates competitive advantage
- Lead with strategic value (10x efficiency, scaling) before tactical features
- Acknowledge their sophistication (built HubSpot from ground up)
- Demonstrate platform flexibility for custom integrations
- Respect time constraints while showing depth of capability

**What Doesn't** (learned from experience):

- Avoid purely tactical feature demos without strategic context
- Don't assume they're starting from zero (very sophisticated HubSpot setup)

**Key Opportunity Areas**:

1. Custom quoting software integration with HubSpot
2. Proposal building automation (expressed interest)
3. Call scoring/coaching for sales team and franchisees
4. Meeting data classification and lead attribution
5. Email intelligence (Outlook integration)

**Next Steps Committed**:

- Follow-up demo: Wednesday, November 12 at 1:00 PM Central (12:00 PM Mountain)
- Charles will share screen showing their systems
- Charles will prepare pain points list prior to meeting
- Mike will send: recap email, use cases documentation, agent examples
