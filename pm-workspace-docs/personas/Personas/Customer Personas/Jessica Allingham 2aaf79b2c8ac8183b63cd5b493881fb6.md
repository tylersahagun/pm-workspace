# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 13, 2025 - Voicemail (no conversation) - Mike attempted to reach Jessica before their scheduled meeting to optimize meeting time

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 15% - Unable to match with any persona

**Classification Rationale**:
No persona match can be made at this time. This interaction consisted solely of a voicemail left FOR Jessica by Mike from AskElephant. Jessica did not answer the call, so no conversation occurred. There is insufficient data to determine Jessica's role, communication style, pain points, goals, or decision-making authority.

The only signals available are:

1. Jessica has a meeting scheduled with AskElephant (indicates interest/evaluation phase)
2. She works at Ariox (based on email domain)
3. Mike wanted to prep before their meeting (suggests meeting has strategic importance)

**NEXT STEPS**: This entry MUST be updated after the actual meeting occurs to capture:

- Jessica's actual role and responsibilities
- Her pain points and challenges
- Her goals and objectives
- Communication style and decision authority
- Proper persona matching
