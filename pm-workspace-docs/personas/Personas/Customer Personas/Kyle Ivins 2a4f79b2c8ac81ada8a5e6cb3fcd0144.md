## Meeting History

- Meeting 1: 2025-11-07 - Initial founder connection discussing fundraising strategy and seeking advice on investor targeting

## Persona Validation Summary

Match Confidence: 85% match with Roger (Revenue Leader)

Secondary Traits: Shows 25% traits of Odis (Operations) - technical background, systems thinking

Classification Rationale: Kyle is a founder/CEO with complete decision-making authority and direct accountability for revenue outcomes. While at early startup stage ($30K MRR, raising$ 3M seed), he exhibits core Revenue Leader traits: strategic thinking about market positioning, high-stakes pressure management, relationship-driven approach, and responsibility for company growth trajectory. His primary 'revenue motion' is currently fundraising rather than traditional sales, but the leadership mindset and accountability structure align strongly with Roger persona.
