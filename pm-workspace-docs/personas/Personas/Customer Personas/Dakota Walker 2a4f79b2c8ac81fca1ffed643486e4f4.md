Key Quotes: "We've got an AI governance board that there are strategic leaders from the entire company that anything that says AI needs to go through them."

"I think it really depends on the enterprise level, like, what that company is, what their sales process note taking is. Because I think right now, it's probably pretty segmented at Avanti."

"A big hurdle to get through at enterprise levels, especially a company like Avanti, which is security focused, a lot of our customers, government agencies, is getting past, like, security."

Tools Mentioned: Chorus, Gong, Microsoft Teams, Salesforce, Zoom, ZoomInfo
Traits That Don't Match: • Less hands-on than typical Odis - has team of 10+ Salesforce developers doing day-to-day work
• More technical depth - strong Salesforce background, understands conversational intelligence space
• Enterprise complexity - operates in much larger organization than AskElephant's ICP (mid-market)
• Influencer vs. buyer - doesn't make purchase decisions directly, acts as gatekeeper/advisor
• Security-first mindset - works with classified government data, has unique compliance requirements
Traits That Match: • Systems thinking - considers enterprise-wide impact of technology decisions
• Governance mindset - emphasizes AI governance board, procurement processes, security reviews
• Integration concerns - mentions shadow IT, redundant systems, technical debt from 8-12 acquisitions
• Strategic oversight - oversees Salesforce team at higher level, pulled in for expertise when needed
• Process-oriented - discusses procurement motions, security protocols, international compliance
Validation Notes: Dakota is a senior IT/operations leader at Ivanti (5,000+ employees) with deep Salesforce expertise (10+ developers on team). He operates at strategic level, not day-to-day implementation. Shows Odis traits (systems thinking, governance focus, integration concerns) but also demonstrates technical depth beyond typical operations role. Strong security consciousness due to government clients. Acts as influencer/gatekeeper for AI tools - must go through AI governance board. Not a decision maker for purchases but critical voice in vetting process.
Validation Status: ⚠️ Partial Match (60-79%)
