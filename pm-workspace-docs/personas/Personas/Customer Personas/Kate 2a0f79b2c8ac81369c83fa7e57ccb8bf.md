# Kate

AE Contact: Peter Belliston
Company: WeAssist
Email: hello@weassist.io
Persona: Odis (https://www.notion.so/Odis-27ff79b2c8ac8056b9ece0a780fbd900?pvs=21)

Executive Assistant/Operations Manager presenting as Odis persona (operations-focused) with Celine traits (enablement). Manages relationship intelligence system including photo documentation for all clients. Current responsibilities: Manual Fireflies invitation to every meeting, organizing recordings into Google Drive folders by type (sales/recruitment), managing meeting documentation across team. Pain points: Platform fatigue (Quantum → Fireflies → AskElephant), significant manual workload organizing calls, team concerns about another migration. Will benefit most from automation - Pete promised "we're gonna make your life so much easier." Pragmatic about change if value outweighs disruption. Advocates for selective rollout (high-call-volume users first).

## Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: November 3, 2025 - AskElephant Product Demo (Operations Perspective)

## Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: **Odis (Operations)** with **Celine (CSM/Enablement)** traits

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Clear Odis persona - operations manager focused on process efficiency and team enablement

**Why this classification**:
Kate demonstrates classic Odis characteristics as an operations-focused professional managing the day-to-day execution of meeting documentation systems. She's responsible for the relationship intelligence infrastructure (photo documentation, meeting notes, client dossiers) and handles manual processes that currently consume significant time. However, she also shows Celine traits in her customer success mindset - she's building systems to enable better client relationships and team collaboration. She's the person who makes everyone else more effective.

## Aggregated Behavioral Insights

### Consistent Patterns:

- **Detail-Oriented Executor**: Manages relationship intelligence system including photo documentation for all client interactions
- **Process Owner**: Responsible for Fireflies invitation to every meeting, organizing recordings into structured Google Drive folders
- **Team Enabler**: Creates systems that help the entire team access information and maintain client relationships
- **Change-Weary but Pragmatic**: Voiced concern about platform fatigue but willing if value is clear
- **Advocates for Incremental Adoption**: Suggested selective rollout starting with high-call-volume users

### Communication Preferences:

- **Direct and Practical**: Asks straightforward questions about functionality ("It will also automatically update the CRM?")
- **Team-Focused**: Considers impact on broader team ("How the team will accept")
- **Historical Context**: References past changes ("We moved from Quantum, and then we moved to Fireflies")
- **Detail-Seeking**: Wants to understand technical specifics ("Is that also possible to bring all our Fireflies recording to here?")

## Strategic Engagement Playbook

**Current Stage**: Cautiously Optimistic

### What We've Learned Works:

- **Acknowledge Past Pain**: Pete recognized her workload ("Kate, we're gonna make your life so much easier")
- **Address Change Fatigue**: Being transparent about migration challenges resonated
- **Quantify Time Savings**: Focusing on automation of her manual work (hours saved daily)
- **Phased Approach**: Selective rollout recommendation aligned with her concerns

### What to Avoid:

- **Don't Minimize Migration Complexity**: Kate knows how hard platform changes are
- **Don't Overpromise Quick Fixes**: She's experienced enough to know implementations take time
- **Don't Ignore Team Impact**: She's thinking about everyone, not just herself

### Current Priorities:

1. Reduce manual work organizing and filing recordings
2. Maintain running documentation for all meetings
3. Ensure team adoption and minimal disruption
4. Preserve historical data and relationship intelligence
5. Simplify multi-tool workflows (Fireflies + manual Google Drive + Slack)

- Document success stories and time savings
- Address team concerns proactively
- Celebrate quick wins (e.g., first automated Google Drive upload)
- Create simple training resources

### Watch For:

- ⚠️ Signs of team resistance or confusion
- ⚠️ Additional manual processes that surface during implementation
- ⚠️ Opportunities to further simplify her workflows
- ✅ Moments to celebrate time savings and efficiency gains

### Opportunity:

- 💡 Kate could become internal champion once she experiences time savings
- 📊 Her process documentation could inform best practices for other AskElephant customers
- 🎯 Success with Kate = success with entire WeAssist team (she's the operations backbone)

## Persona Flexibility Note

Kate is primarily **Odis (Operations)** - focused on execution, processes, and team enablement - but shows **Celine (CSM)** tendencies in how she builds systems to enable better customer relationships.

**Engagement Strategy**: Lead with operational efficiency and time savings (Odis appeals), but also highlight how automation enables better client service and relationship intelligence (Celine appeals). She'll champion the platform if she sees both personal productivity gains AND team/client benefits.
