Key Quotes: One of the main selling points for me... the vision of this is we want this to be kind of a second brain or an LLM that we can ping with any information.

We don't know what we don't know, but you guys work with a number of different businesses that are probably using things in a more creative way.

We're working with Slack on their system right now... whoever's gonna get us the data the most effective way is ultimately who I think we'll end up using.
