# Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: November 11, 2025 - CSM Introduction call with Erika (CSM) and Jazz (AI Strategist). Holly was present but did not speak due to severe technical/audio difficulties. John Karlo Torres identified her as "Head of Sales" with separate needs from the AI implementation focus.

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 55% match with Roger (Revenue Leader)
**Secondary Traits**: Could potentially be Aaron (AE) if more individually contributor-focused - need direct conversation

**Classification Rationale**:
Holly is identified as Head of Sales, which strongly suggests Revenue Leader persona (Roger). However, without direct communication, confidence is low. The fact that she has "separate needs" from AI implementation suggests sales-specific challenges around quota, pipeline, or team performance. Title suggests strategic/leadership level, but actual scope and authority need validation through conversation.
