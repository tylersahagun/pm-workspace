- Very long sales cycles (6 months to 5 years decision timelines)
- High-value, consultative selling

**Tech Stack:**
- HubSpot (CRM)
- Fathom (current meeting intelligence tool)
- Aware of Make.com automation possibilities

1. Automatic CRM field population from meeting transcripts
2. Timeline-based prospect segmentation (when they want to sell)

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 75% match with Roger (Revenue Leader)
**Secondary Traits**: Shows 30% traits of Odis (Operations) - hands-on execution focus

**Classification Rationale**:
Khaled is classified as a Roger persona primarily because:

1. He has clear decision-making authority (no approval process mentioned)
2. He's thinking strategically about long-term relationship management (multi-year nurture cycles)
3. He's focused on team efficiency and scalability with limited resources
4. He understands the ROI of automation and is already using tools like Fathom

However, this is a "Partial Match" (75%) because:

- His team is much smaller than typical Roger (4 vs 10-20+)
- He's more operationally hands-on than strategic/managerial
- His focus is on execution tools rather than reporting/dashboards
- He represents a unique use case (M&A advisory) not typical B2B SaaS

The 30% Odis traits come from his hands-on operational focus and concern with day-to-day CRM data quality.
