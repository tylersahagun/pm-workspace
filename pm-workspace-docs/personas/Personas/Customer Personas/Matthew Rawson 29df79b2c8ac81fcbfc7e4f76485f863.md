# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: October 31, 2025 - Product demo and strategic value discussion (Intro to AskElephant)

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Aaron (Strategic Buyer) with Celine (Relationship Builder) traits

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Clearly presented as Aaron with strong strategic focus, but showed Celine characteristics when discussing team adoption and change management

**Why this classification**:
Matthew demonstrated Aaron characteristics through his focus on strategic value, manager-level use cases, and concern about how the tool fits into their broader tech ecosystem. He repeatedly asked about manager workflows ("deal intervention to flag me"), team enablement ("how is this gonna help a rep"), and integration strategy ("help us see how it connects all of these different tools"). However, he also showed Celine traits with his concern for rep adoption, change management challenges, and wanting to ensure the tool makes life easier rather than harder for his team.

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns Across Meetings:**

- Thinks from a manager/leadership perspective first, individual contributor second
- Highly focused on team adoption and change management
- Wants to see strategic value and ROI, not just features
- Protective of his team's time and cognitive load ("we're trying to remove" work, not add it)
- Already invested in multiple tools - needs clear differentiation and integration story

**Communication Preferences:**

- Values strategic narrative over technical details
- Appreciates honesty and direct feedback
- Willing to provide constructive criticism ("I'm not really seeing how this is gonna work for us")
- Prefers efficiency - has hard stops and time constraints

# Strategic Engagement Playbook (Updated)

**Current Stage**: Active Prospect - Strategic Evaluation Phase

**What We've Learned Works:**

- Acknowledging his team's existing tool investments (Outreach, Salesforce, Play)
- Focusing on manager-level insights and deal intervention capabilities
- Being responsive to his feedback and willing to adjust the approach
- Respecting his time constraints

**What to Avoid (learned from experience):**

- Deep technical demonstrations without connecting to strategic value first
- Feature tours that don't address "how will this help my reps"
- Building workflows in real-time without clear context on business impact
- Ignoring his signals about being lost or not seeing the connection

**Current Priorities:**

1. **Manager-level Deal Intelligence**: Ability to identify which deals need intervention without reviewing 100 calls
2. **Compliance Opportunity Flagging**: Automatically identify upsell opportunities (SOC 2, FedRAMP) from prospect conversations
3. **Clear Integration Story**: Understanding how AskElephant enhances (not duplicates) their Outreach + Salesforce investment
4. **Rep Enablement Without Burden**: Ensuring the tool makes reps' lives easier, not adding another system to learn

# Key Quotes Across All Meetings

**Meeting 1**: "But then what does that look like for the manager? Because from my seat, it's that deal intervention to flag me and say, hey. There's been, like, a 100 calls today, but you need to look at this one because these guys mentioned x y z, and there's a whole lot of other possibilities that we could be selling to them."

Context: This perfectly captures Matthew's Aaron persona - he's thinking about scalability, prioritization, and strategic opportunity identification at the manager level.

**Meeting 1**: "I'm not really seeing how this is gonna work for us on Outreach with all of the different pieces we have. What I am seeing is a whole lot of potential and I'm going, okay. That can go somewhere. That can go somewhere. But I'm also seeing a lot of work, which is what we're trying to remove."

Context: Matthew provides direct, constructive feedback while remaining engaged. He sees potential but needs the integration and value story clarified. This is classic Aaron behavior - strategic evaluation with healthy skepticism.

**Meeting 1**: "We're really needing to see, like, this is how it's gonna help a rep. Because we're already getting reps being like, oh, man. If I gotta, like, learn Outreach and I just wanna use my cell phone and and Outlook."

Context: Shows his Celine traits - deeply concerned about team adoption, change management, and ensuring tools serve people (not the other way around).

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions/Blockers:**

- Works closely with Arthur Lorente (technical decision maker) - they're tag-teaming the evaluation
- Matthew is the strategic buyer while Arthur is the technical validator
- Has direct authority over sales team tooling decisions
- Reports to higher leadership who controls budget
- Concerned about rep pushback - needs to manage up and down

**Decision Dynamics:**

- Authority level: High - likely final decision maker for sales tools with budget approval needed from above
- Key influencers: Arthur (technical validation), sales reps (user adoption), finance/leadership (budget approval)
- Budget control: Strong influence - mentions "paying for all the bloody bells and whistles" indicating budget awareness and authority

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on aggregate learnings:**

1. **Schedule a strategic value session**: Focus on manager use cases, ROI story, and how AskElephant complements (not replaces) their Outreach investment
2. **Create a clear integration narrative**: Build a visual showing how AskElephant sits alongside Salesforce, Outreach, and Play to create compound value
3. **Develop rep-focused value props**: Show 3-5 specific ways AskElephant makes reps' lives easier with their existing workflow
4. **Provide customer success stories**: Share examples of companies with similar tool stacks who successfully adopted AskElephant

**Watch for:**

- Change fatigue - they're in the middle of rolling out Outreach, adding another tool could be timing issue
- Budget approval process - he has influence but may need to build internal business case
- Rep resistance - if the team pushes back on Outreach, adding AskElephant could face similar headwinds
- Need for quick wins - he may need to see immediate value to justify continued investment

# Persona Flexibility Note

Matthew operates primarily as Aaron (Strategic Buyer) when evaluating business value and manager-level capabilities, but shifts to Celine (Relationship Builder) when discussing his team, adoption challenges, and change management. Lead with Aaron strategies (strategic value, manager insights, integration story) but be ready to pivot to Celine tactics (team enablement, ease of use, reducing burden) when discussing implementation and rollout. He needs both the strategic "why" and the empathetic "how will this help my people" to move forward.
