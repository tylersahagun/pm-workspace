Key Quotes: "If I had a dollar for every time five minutes before a second call was about to start and be like, what did I quote this person? Because I couldn't find it in my notes and I did not remember for the life of me. I would literally go to AskElephant and ask that question and immediately would spit out the answer so I didn't look like an idiot going into that call." "Every Monday morning, I get a report that goes back and listens to all of my AEs demos, and then it gives me points of what I need to train on that week."
