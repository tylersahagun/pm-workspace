# ⚠️ MENTORSHIP RELATIONSHIP - NOT A CUSTOMER

This is a career coaching/mentorship interaction, not a sales prospect.

# Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: November 4, 2025 - Initial mentorship call (15 min → 38 min)

# Persona Assessment

**Current**: Aaron (Aspiring SDR/AE)

**Why**: Femi's goals and mindset align with Aaron persona - results-oriented, seeking autonomy, focused on personal branding, willing to go against the grain to stand out.

# Profile

- **Location**: Lagos, Nigeria
- **Current Role**: BDR at 3D modeling company (real estate) - 3 months experience
- **Status**: In school while job searching
- **Job Search**: 3-4 weeks in, targeting remote SDR roles at North American tech companies
- **Key Challenge**: Location-based hiring barriers, needs fully remote roles

# Job Search Strategy

**Target Companies** (~10 total):

- Chili Piper, RemotePAS, Watchit, JLBOS, Otherway, AppCrafters, Top Payments, Olympian
- **New discoveries from session**: Volley, Everlaw (62 sales), HubSpot, Hyperverge, Uteva

**Criteria**: Companies with track record hiring employees from Nigeria (not necessarily SDRs)

**Approach**:

- Creating personalized video outreach to hiring managers
- Building LinkedIn presence with content creation
- Planning to start international cold calling (hasn't started yet)
- Using ChatGPT for content but working on authentic voice

# Mike's Key Advice

**Standing Out**:

- Don't follow templates or generic advice - go against the grain
- Be memorable through personality, not perfection
- Post about sports (basketball), experiences, personality
- "You can teach someone to cold call, but you can't teach someone to stand out"

**LinkedIn Strategy**:

- Stop reposting own content multiple times (looks "try hard")
- Use one ChatGPT thread for all posts to maintain voice consistency
- Remove hashtags and AI formatting
- Post frequently without overthinking
- Include images showing hands/face (builds trust)
- Tag Mike before posting so he can engage early

**Outreach**:

- Focus on LinkedIn over email (Mike books 100% of meetings via LinkedIn)
- Create targeted outreach videos
- Use Sales Navigator to find companies already hiring from Nigeria
- Target companies valuing outcomes over activities

**Mindset**:

- "Harvard analogy": Be in the "homeschool" pool (different evaluation criteria) vs. traditional high school competition
- "If you want different results, you need a different strategy"
- Some companies will reject this approach - that's okay
- Find companies that want different people for different results

# Sales Navigator Research Method

**Filters Used**:

1. People in Nigeria
2. Software industry
3. SDR/BDR titles
4. Company HQ in North America
5. 50-200 employees (sweet spot)

**Result**: Identified companies already with Nigerian SDRs/BDRs

# Action Items for Femi

1. ✅ Post about mentoring session (tag Mike first)
2. Research international calling protocols
3. Start cold calling North American companies
4. Create targeted outreach videos
5. Use Sales Navigator to expand company list
6. Post more authentic content about personality/interests
7. Stop reposting own content
8. Consolidate past posts into ChatGPT for tone analysis

# Key Quotes

**Femi**: "Because I'm from Nigeria...it's a bit more difficult for me to get jobs because they have to be fully remote."

**Mike**: "You need to stand out in a different way...that's either gonna be in how you talk, what you say, or the impression that you give."

**Mike**: "I booked a meeting off of that pool drain post" (proving authentic content works)

# Relationship Notes

**Origin**: Femi sent LinkedIn connection (initially denied due to volume), then commented on Mike's post and scheduled call, Mike then connected

**Mike's Commitment**:

- Will engage with Femi's LinkedIn posts when tagged
- Will review occasional posts if sent (but not all)
- Light ongoing support, not intensive coaching

**Next Expected Interaction**: Femi will post about this session and tag Mike

# Success Metrics

- Femi lands remote SDR role at tech company
- Builds authentic LinkedIn presence
- Implements video outreach successfully
- Positive social proof for both on LinkedIn

**Personal Connection Points**: Basketball, sports, school/education

**Communication**: LinkedIn DMs, casual/direct feedback style
