# Meeting History

**Meeting 1: November 5, 2025** - KLAS | AskElephant Weekly Sync

- **Context**: Listed as attendee for Salesforce integration troubleshooting session
- **Chandler's Participation**: Did not speak or actively participate in the meeting
- **Indirect References**: Connor Northrup mentioned sending emails/updates to Chandler, indicating oversight or approval role
- **Outcome**: Insufficient data to analyze communication style, pain points, or goals

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 30% confidence - **Insufficient Data**

**Secondary Traits**: Cannot be determined from this meeting

**Classification Rationale**:

Chandler was listed as an attendee but did not participate in the technical troubleshooting discussion. Based on Connor's reference to sending updates to Chandler, and the fact that Chandler is included in weekly sync meetings, several hypotheses emerge:

**Possible Personas**:

1. **Roger (Revenue Leader)** - If Chandler is a VP/Director level who oversees operations and requires visibility into vendor relationships
2. **Celine (CSM)** or **Odis (Operations)** - If Chandler manages the customer success or operations team that uses AskElephant
3. **Aaron (AE)** - Less likely, but possible if Chandler is involved in vendor evaluation/procurement

**Data Needed**:

- Speaking patterns and communication style in meetings where Chandler actively participates
- Role and responsibilities at KLAS Research (check LinkedIn, company website, or ask Connor directly)
- Pain points and goals expressed in their own words
- Decision-making authority demonstrated through actions

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

## Observable Patterns:

- **Delegation Style**: Appears to delegate technical implementation to Connor while maintaining oversight
- **Meeting Attendance**: Invited to weekly syncs suggests ongoing stakeholder interest
- **Communication Preference**: May prefer written updates over live meeting participation (Connor mentions emailing Chandler)

## Hypotheses to Test:

- **Senior Leadership Role**: Attendance without active participation suggests strategic oversight rather than tactical involvement
- **Time Management**: May be monitoring multiple initiatives simultaneously, attending but not actively participating unless escalation needed
- **Trust in Team**: Comfortable allowing Connor to lead technical discussions with vendors
