# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 3, 2025 - AskElephant Platform Onboarding

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Irina (Implementation) - Primary

**Why this classification**:
Christopher is implementation/operations lead:

- Handles setup and post-sale work
- Has support team under him
- First to ask technical integration questions (Zoom vs Google)
- Concerned with HOW things connect
- Gatekeeping decision about adding Nick (support team)

# Behavioral Insights

**Key Patterns:**

- Technical orientation
- Implementation focus on data flow
- Observant: let others ask first, then filled gaps
- Team-oriented: thinks about support team needs
- Measured participation: spoke less but high-value questions

**Pain Points:**

- Technical integration complexity (Zoom, HubSpot, Slack)
- Post-sale team needs vs sales team needs
- Ensuring smooth sales-to-support handoffs
- Managing team adoption

# Strategic Engagement Playbook

**What Resonates:**

- Clear technical documentation
- Understanding integration architecture
- Post-sale workflow automation
- Support team enablement features
- Reliable system performance

**What to Avoid:**

- Glossing over technical details
- Ignoring support team's specific needs
- Rushing implementation

# Key Quotes

"Because we you guys use Google Meetings, and so we use Zoom... do we need to connect Zoom, or does AskElephant record the Zoom meeting, and then does it save it to HubSpot?" - Critical implementation question

"Yeah. I'll add him eventually. We wanna meet" - Gatekeeping support team access, phased rollout

# Next Steps

1. Follow-up onboarding with Erica (11/6/25 at 9:15 AM Mountain)
2. Ensure Zoom integration configured properly
3. Build sales-to-support handoff workflow
4. Create customer health monitoring for support team

**Critical**: His success = team-wide adoption. His frustration = sales-only tool.
