Validation Notes: Clayton continues to demonstrate strong Odis (Operations) traits with Roger (Revenue Leader) characteristics. In this CSM onboarding call, he's orchestrating the CS team pilot with Ali Sanchez and VP Chris Gika. He's managing the 2-3 month trial, coordinating side-by-side comparisons with incumbent tool, and focusing on sentiment tracking and churn alert functionality. He's thoughtful about permissions, privacy settings, and workflow automation (feedback calls auto-private, sharing with managers). Shows strategic planning with future Asana integration and sales-to-CS handoff workflows. Continues to be the primary champion and decision maker for cross-functional AskElephant rollout.
Validation Status: ✅ Strong Match (80-100%)

# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: 2025-11-05 - Pre-start consultation with James Hinkson (starts Nov 17th)

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 75% match with Aaron (AE)
**Secondary Traits**: Shows 40% traits of Odis (Operations) due to automation/process focus

**Classification Rationale**:
Jake is being classified as Aaron (AE) because he's taking over the sales function, but he exhibits strong operational characteristics. His month-long research, playbook building, and focus on automation/workflows suggest he's an AE with RevOps sensibilities. The partial match reflects this hybrid nature - he'll be executing sales but with a systems-thinking approach.
