3. Manual CRM maintenance eating into selling time
4. Need for read/write HubSpot integration with custom fields
5. Conference lead capture and delegation workflows

- Primary objection: Pricing ($600/month for 6 users)
- Decision timeline: Within one week
- Process: Needs CEO approval, evaluating competitors (one meeting Monday)
- Next step: Follow-up Thursday 11/13 at 4PM MT

ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY:
- Emphasize coaching/MEDDIC automation (resonated strongly)
- Show conference lead capture ROI
- Focus on time-to-value concerns
- Position against "feature-rich but hard to learn" competitors
- Reinforce 90%+ retention rate for confidence
Validation Status: ✅ Strong Match (80-100%)

# Meeting History

**Meeting 1: November 7, 2025 - Discovery/Demo Call**

- 32-minute intro call with AE Mike Canova
- Came inbound after SDR conversation with Jamis
- Currently using Fathom, planning to churn
- Exploring AI-powered meeting intelligence and CRM automation

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 92% match with Roger (Revenue Leader)

**Classification Rationale**:
Stirling exhibits nearly all core Roger persona traits: VP-level GTM leader, managing scaling sales team, obsessed with operational efficiency, hates manual CRM work, needs data-driven insights from customer conversations, uses proven sales methodology (MEDDIC), and makes budget decisions with CEO approval. His pain points align perfectly with Roger's "disconnected tools and manual data entry" frustrations. The 8% gap comes from less emphasis on board reporting and strategic forecasting compared to typical CRO-level Rogers.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Communication Style**:

- Direct and efficient - "cuts to the chase"
- Comfortable with profanity for emphasis ("can't fucking find it")
- Asks tactical questions immediately (pricing, onboarding)
- Values transparency (cameras off, eating lunch during call)

**Decision-Making Approach**:

- Rapid evaluation cycle (one week decision window)
- Parallel vendor evaluation (meeting with competitor Monday)
- Bottoms-up recommendation to CEO
- ROI-focused: "It's all a function of pricing what we're getting"
- Confidence in current tools low (definitive on churning Fathom)

# Aggregated Insights

**Pain Points (by priority)**:

1. **Data Extraction Failure** - Fathom can't capture critical business info (team size, volume, pricing details) that's "super critical" for their models
2. **No Automated Action Items** - Wants AI to generate tasks, HubSpot updates, follow-ups automatically with human review
3. **Manual CRM Burden** - "CRM health and hygiene is massively important" but drains selling time
4. **Conference Lead Management** - Currently manual CSV uploads with delegation workflows
5. **Custom Field Population** - Needs read/write HubSpot access, not just note logging

**Goals Consistency**:

- **Primary**: Maximize selling time by automating CRM/admin work
- **Secondary**: Scale team operations as pipeline grows
- **Tertiary**: Implement coaching/MEDDIC tracking for 6 AEs

**Tools & Methodology**:

- CRM: HubSpot (heavy customization)
- Current notetaker: Fathom (churning)
- Sales methodology: MEDDIC
- Team size: 6 AEs (all seasoned), BDRs starting January

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**What Works**:
✅ MEDDIC coaching automation (immediate interest: "We're doing this all manually")
✅ Conference mobile app for lead capture
✅ HubSpot custom field population demos
✅ Workflow/agent building offers (vs DIY platforms)
✅ 90%+ retention rate stat (builds confidence)
✅ 30-day paid pilot pitch (addresses commitment concerns)

**What to Avoid**:
❌ Complex onboarding narratives (he asked upfront about learning curve)
❌ Feature overload (keep focused on core pain points)
❌ Pressure tactics (he's methodical, needs CEO buy-in)
❌ Glossing over pricing (he brought it up twice)

**Objection Handling**:

- Price sensitivity: Acknowledged "of course, who doesn't want cheaper"
- Learning curve: Reassured with "pretty intuitive" and weekly check-ins
- Decision authority: Needs CEO approval - position as de-risked with pilot

**Next Steps**:

- Follow-up meeting: Thursday, November 13 at 4PM MT (5PM PT)
- He'll have talked to CEO and evaluated competitor by then
- Likely outcome: Pilot agreement or final objections to overcome
