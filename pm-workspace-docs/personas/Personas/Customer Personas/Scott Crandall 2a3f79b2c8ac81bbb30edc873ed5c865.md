Key Quotes: We don't really have a Gong or anything like that. Currently, we get call recordings from Zoom. They disappear after sixty days.

Have a good conversational intelligence tool, be able to use that for kind of coaching, scoring, rep feedback as as real time as possible, manager insights into kind of, like, trends

General coaching or following our sales methodology in general is, like, it's tough to do at scale. I have time to listen to one call a week per rep or something like that.

Minimize rep admin time, but drive us to be able to spend more time on calls, on deal strategy
