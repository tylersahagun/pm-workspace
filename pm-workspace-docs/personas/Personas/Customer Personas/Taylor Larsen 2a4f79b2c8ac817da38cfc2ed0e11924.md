# Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: November 7, 2025 - Partnership exploration call with Pete Belliston. Initial discussion about mutual referral partnership between AskElephant and BigLeap's HubSpot RevOps services.

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 75% match with **Roger (Revenue Leader)**

**Secondary Traits**: Shows 40% traits of **Odis (Operations Leader)** due to strong RevOps focus

**Classification Rationale**:
Taylor exhibits strong Revenue Leader characteristics through his role managing an 8-10 person sales team, focus on partnership revenue models (10%/5% lifetime structures), and strategic thinking about full-funnel optimization. His emphasis on removing obstacles for sales teams, coaching scalability, and pipeline efficiency align with Roger's core motivations.

However, he operates more as a Sales Operations/Partnerships leader within an agency context rather than traditional enterprise revenue leadership. He shows notable operational traits through hands-on HubSpot expertise, custom system building (ChatGPT coaching scorecards), and service productization mindset. Decision authority is "Influencer" rather than final decision maker (defers to James/tech team for tool adoption).
