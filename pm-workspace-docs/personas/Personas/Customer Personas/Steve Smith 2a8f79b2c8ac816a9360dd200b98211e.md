Tools Mentioned: ERP systems, Gong, HubSpot, NetSuite
Traits That Don't Match: • Less process-documentation focused than typical Odis
• More hands-on builder than delegator at this stage
• Faster decision pace due to startup environment
Traits That Match: • Brand new to org (onboarding chaos)
• Owns ops solo ('I am him')
• Wants self-sufficiency (learn over weekend)
• Technical capability (building scorecards)
• Multi-team management (SDR, SMB, Enterprise)
• System integrator mindset (ERP, HubSpot, webhooks)
• Analytical focus (tracking metrics, dashboards)
Validation Notes: Steve is a clear Odis (Operations) persona - solo ops leader at Canopy who's brand new to the org and managing sales analytics infrastructure. Key indicators:

**Strong Odis Traits:**
- Solo ops ownership across multiple teams
- Building tracking/scoring systems from scratch
- Needs workflow automation for different team types
- Technical enough to want to learn the system
- Integration planning (HubSpot, future ERP)
- Performance analytics focus

**Unique Context:**
- Extreme velocity environment (transactional SMB with 12-14 calls/day)
- Managing both transactional and enterprise motions
- Collections/AR considerations for post-sale
- Referenced by Woody for special attention

**Engagement Strategy:**
- Needs hand-holding initially but wants independence
- Teach-while-building approach resonates
- Time-constrained (weekend learning preference)
- Values practical demos over theoretical discussions
Validation Status: ✅ Strong Match (80-100%)

# Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: 2025-11-11 - Sales Analytics Workflow Configuration (Initial scoping call)

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 85% match with Odis (Operations)

**Secondary Traits**: Shows 20% traits of Aaron (AE) due to hands-on sales process knowledge

**Classification Rationale**:
Steve is definitively an Odis persona - a solo operations leader managing sales infrastructure across multiple teams. Key evidence includes:

- Self-identified as "the ops guy" for the entire organization
- Building scorecards, tracking systems, and analytics from scratch
- Managing workflows for SDRs, SMB AEs, and Enterprise teams with different criteria
- Planning HubSpot and ERP integrations
- Wants to be self-sufficient with the platform

His unique position as brand new to Canopy (onboarding) and managing high-velocity transactional sales alongside enterprise deals makes him a textbook operations persona with urgency.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Initial Interaction Patterns**:

- Direct and efficiency-focused communication
- Asks clarifying questions to validate capabilities
- Skeptical but open ("I'm not happy yet")
- Action-oriented (wants to start immediately)
- Time-conscious (mentioned weekend work, FEMA commitments)

**Decision-Making Style**:

- Validates requirements before committing
- Needs to see proof (demo was critical)
- Fast decision once validated (moved to scheduling immediately)
- Wants to maintain control through learning

# Aggregated Insights

**Pain Points** (from this meeting):

- Living in "chaos" with current sales analytics
- Manual tracking across multiple team types
- No unified view of rep performance
- Differentiating SDR vs AE vs Enterprise metrics
- Collections team needs call context

**Goals Identified**:

- Primary: Implement Gong-like coaching insights without AI agents
- Enable reps to self-assess performance (talk time, questions, objections)
- Segment tracking by team type (SDR/SMB/Enterprise)
- Build dashboards for executive visibility
- Become self-sufficient with AskElephant platform
- Future: Integrate with ERP for AR/collections context

**Technical Requirements**:

- HubSpot Enterprise (likely)
- Custom workflows by team
- Conditional logic for different sale types
- Dashboard and reporting capabilities
- Webhook integration to future ERP
- QBR and performance summary outputs

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**What Works**:

- Show don't tell (live demo was decisive)
- Acknowledge time constraints and offer support
- Teach-while-building approach
- Practical examples from your own usage
- Quick validation of capabilities

**What to Avoid**:

- Over-complicating the solution
- Theoretical discussions without proof
- Assuming he has bandwidth to DIY everything
- Ignoring his unique dual-motion (transactional + enterprise)

**Engagement Recommendations**:

- Provide scaffolding and templates he can customize
- Schedule focused scoping call (Monday 2pm CT confirmed)
- Send Star Wars demo screenshots as promised
- Expect detailed documentation from him by Thursday
- Offer HubSpot field-building support (special accommodation per Woody)
- Plan for phased rollout (walk → run → cross country)
