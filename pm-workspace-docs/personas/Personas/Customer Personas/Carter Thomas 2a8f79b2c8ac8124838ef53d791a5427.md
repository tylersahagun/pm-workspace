Key Quotes: 1. 'One of the things that I'm super stoked about is I've never been able to actually use the LinkedIn how I wanna use it because all the companies that worked for were dealing with, you know, hoity toity title people where they didn't wanna have that kind of engagement'

2. 'For me, what I most enjoy right now is the freedom to be able to go out and be myself and create a voice. Because that was what I was trying to do, and that's, again, one of the reasons I was so drawn to y'all is because each and every one of you has a unique voice perspective'

3. 'I have an idea of doing something similar to that [Julio's Jenga content]. Few ideas running... cooking while cold calling, building a card tower... I wanna do a lot of comedic things'

Validation Notes: Carter is a new hire at AskElephant in an SDR role. This is an internal coaching call with Mike about LinkedIn content strategy. Carter shows strong alignment with Aaron persona as a sales development professional focused on prospecting, but with unique video content creation skills. He's in the early stages of developing his voice and brand. Key motivator is the freedom to be authentic and creative, which he lacked in previous roles. Mike is coaching him on LinkedIn best practices: tell specific stories, don't jam multiple ideas together, maintain authenticity, avoid direct pitching, and focus on quality over quantity.
