Email: courtney@usergems.com
Key Quotes: **On Team Challenges:**
'When I became the outbound manager in June, we cleaned house and we hired four new people. So everyone is within four months of starting... we had our first month last month where it was like, multiple people didn't hit quota.'

**On LinkedIn Strategy:**
'We haven't actually gotten to, like, the here's, like, actually what to do part. It's just been pushed to the back burner... I'm my own worst offender, a little bit of, like, a user gems billboard.'

**On Partnership Interest:**
'I'm pretty sure this is a competitor... but it's almost like we would do everything building up to the point of, like, actually having people worked in the pipeline, actually having accounts that are being advertised to. And then AskElephant comes in and is, like, analyzing things.'

Validation Notes: Initial discovery call. Courtney manages an outbound SDR/BDR team at UserGems and is currently facing challenges with a completely new team (all hired within 4 months). Team historically had 100% quota attainment but is now struggling as reps ramp. She's interested in LinkedIn engagement strategies and coaching methodologies. Shows strong operational focus on team performance but also wears partnerships hat. Not primary ICP for AskElephant (RevOps/AE/CSM would be better fit), but potential partnership opportunity exists.
Validation Status: ⚠️ Partial Match (60-79%)
