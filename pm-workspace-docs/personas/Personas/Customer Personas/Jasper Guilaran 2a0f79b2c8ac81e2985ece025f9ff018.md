# Jasper Guilaran

AE Contact: Michael Haimowitz
Company: WIZA
Email: jasper.guilaran@wiza.com
Persona: Roger (https://www.notion.so/Roger-27ff79b2c8ac80f38e6bd36a602af48b?pvs=21)

# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 3, 2025 - Peer learning/coaching call (Mike's 1:1 with Jasper)

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: **Roger (The Practitioner)** with minor **Aaron (The Connector)** traits

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Clearly presents as Roger - tactical SDR seeking hands-on improvement strategies for LinkedIn prospecting and call execution

**Why this classification**:
Jasper exhibits classic Roger behaviors throughout the conversation. He's a frontline SDR focused on daily execution, asking tactical "how-to" questions about LinkedIn pitching, transition techniques, and tool usage. His questions are specific and implementation-focused: "How do you switch between personal conversation to pitching?" and "How do you track that on HubSpot?" He's activity-driven (targets 100 dials/day) and seeks proven techniques from successful peers rather than strategic frameworks.

Minor Aaron traits emerge through his relationship-building approach and willingness to make warm introductions, but this is secondary to his core practitioner mindset.

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns Across Meetings:**

- **Tactical learner**: Immediately asks for specific examples and actionable strategies
- **Tool-curious**: Showed interest in Condo, compared to In Labels, discussed pros/cons of various tools
- **Self-aware**: Acknowledged his struggles ("people are creeped out") and seeks improvement
- **High activity focus**: Aims for 100 dials/day, experimenting with different LinkedIn approaches
- **Peer-oriented**: Treats this as colleague-to-colleague learning, not vendor-prospect dynamic

**Communication Preferences (learned in Meeting 1):**

- Best meeting times: Works Eastern hours from Philippines (2:30 AM local time during this call) - completely nocturnal
- Preferred communication style: Casual, friendly, direct peer-to-peer conversation
- Response patterns: Quick to engage, asks follow-up questions, offers reciprocal value unprompted
- Values: Tactical advice over theory, real examples over concepts

# Strategic Engagement Playbook (Initial)

**Current Stage**: Peer relationship / potential advocate (not direct buyer)

**What We've Learned Works:**

- Sharing specific LinkedIn tactics and transition phrases (showed immediate interest)
- Screen sharing tools (Condo demo) and walking through practical workflows
- Being transparent about challenges (Mike shared his calling struggles resonated)
- Peer-to-peer coaching approach rather than selling
- Humor and authenticity in explaining techniques

**What to Avoid (learned from experience):**

- Don't assume he has budget authority (RevOps manages tools at WIZA)
- Don't over-automate suggestions (he dislikes LinkedIn automation despite company providing HeyReach)
- Don't be too high-level or strategic (he wants tactical, implementable advice)

**Current Priorities:**

1. **Improving LinkedIn prospecting success** - Primary pain point, feels people sense his sales intent
2. **Finding the right sales tools** - Invested personal money in Quibly, interested in Condo vs In Labels
3. **Balancing activities** - Trying to optimize between 100 dials/day vs LinkedIn focus
4. **Career/life quality** - Considering moving to US/Canada to escape nocturnal schedule

# Key Quotes from Meeting 1

**On LinkedIn struggles**: "I don't know how you do it, man. I feel like when I start, like, conversations on LinkedIn, I feel like people are creeped out. Like, they they kinda sniff that it's like a sales, like, pitch."
Context: Core pain point - seeking techniques to make LinkedIn outreach feel more authentic

**On Mike's success**: "Damn, dude. I don't know how you do it, man... Awesome month for you last month. I saw you posted about, like, your payment."
Context: Admiration for peer success, motivated by what's working for others

**On tool investment**: "I bought it [Quibly] out of pocket, and I guess it's like an excuse to actually pitch"
Context: Resourceful and willing to invest in tools that help, even without company budget

**On reciprocity**: "Since you guys took a demo from us, I think it's just fair to help you that I help you out."
Context: Values fairness and mutual benefit in relationships

**On LinkedIn automation**: "I'm not really a fan of LinkedIn automations in general"
Context: Prefers authentic engagement despite company providing automation tools

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions/Blockers at WIZA:**

- **RevOps contacts (Tool Decision Makers)**: Jess and Matt - manage Gong, dialers, and sales tools
- **Former API AE**: KJ Chow - moved on, now Maddie manages that segment
- **Former Colleague at Prospect**: Rishi - still there, could be intro path
- **Previous AskElephant Contact**: McKenna - had demo with WIZA before

**Decision Dynamics:**

- Authority level: None for purchasing decisions - individual contributor SDR
- Key influencers: Can make warm intros to Jess (RevOps) and Matt (RevOps) who control tool budgets
- Budget control: No direct control, but willing to advocate and facilitate intros
- Influence potential: **HIGH** - explicitly offered warm intro to decision makers unprompted

**Company Context:**

- WIZA currently uses: Gong (evaluating replacement), HeyReach (for LinkedIn), considering Outreach/SalesLoft
- They had previous interaction with AskElephant (stalled deal before Jasper joined)
- Gong renewal timing uncertain, but evaluating Gong Engage alternatives now
- Open to budget reallocation: Save on Gong to afford better dialer + AskElephant

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on Meeting 1 learnings:**

1. **Accept warm intro to WIZA RevOps (Jess & Matt)** - Jasper offered unprompted, showing genuine advocacy
    - Angle: RevOps value prop (auto-fill fields, reduce AE friction)
    - Timing: Now - they're evaluating Gong Engage alternatives
    - Positioning: Save Gong budget  fund better dialer + AskElephant
2. **Send Jasper the Condo link with free month** - Mike promised this during call
    - Builds goodwill and helps him with immediate pain point
    - Keeps relationship warm through practical value delivery
    - Reinforces peer-helper dynamic
3. **Share LinkedIn pitching techniques follow-up** - He was eager to implement
    - "I totally forgot to pitch you" approach
    - "I'm an SDR, you know why I'm here" humor technique
    - Strengthens relationship through continued coaching
4. **Check with Adia about stalled WIZA deal** - Mike mentioned this as next step
    - Understand why previous engagement didn't progress
    - Avoid repeating past mistakes
    - Jasper mentioned they had demo with McKenna (reverse demo with Clay)

**Watch for:**

- **Opportunity**: Jasper as advocate - he clearly wants to help and has access to decision makers
- **Timing**: WIZA evaluating Gong alternatives NOW - window of opportunity
- **Risk**: Don't rely on Jasper for decision-making authority he doesn't have
- **Career mobility**: He's considering relocating to US/Canada - relationship could strengthen if that happens

**Competitive Intelligence Gathered:**

- WIZA uses Gong (considering replacement)
- Evaluating: Outreach, SalesLoft for dialer
- Using: HeyReach (unpopular with team), Quibly (personal purchase)
- Pain point: AEs "can't live without" Gong but would trade for better dialer if budget allowed

# Persona Flexibility Note

Jasper is definitively **Roger (The Practitioner)** in this stage of his career. He's a tactical, execution-focused SDR seeking immediate performance improvements. While he shows Aaron (Connector) tendencies in relationship-building and intro-making, this is secondary to his core identity as a hands-on operator.

**Engagement strategy**: Treat as peer/practitioner - share tactics, tools, and real examples. Leverage his connector traits by accepting intro offers, but don't expect him to drive purchasing decisions. His value is as an advocate and navigator to actual decision makers (Jess & Matt in RevOps).

**Future evolution potential**: If Jasper moves to AE role or relocates to US, his persona may shift toward more strategic thinking. Monitor career progression.
