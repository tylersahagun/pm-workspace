# Meeting History

- **November 6, 2025**: Feedback session - Limited usage but exploring manager visibility features

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 85% match with Celine (CSM)

**Secondary Traits**: Shows 30% traits of Roger (Revenue Leader) - management oversight and strategic focus

**Classification Rationale**:

Andy displays strong CSM manager characteristics with focus on team enablement, coaching, and scalable processes. As a CS Manager, he's less hands-on than individual contributors but deeply invested in team performance and visibility. His questions center on manager-specific capabilities (viewing team calls, running coaching prompts on others' meetings) and practical use cases that benefit the team (contact role tagging). The limited personal usage is typical for managers who delegate day-to-day tool usage while maintaining oversight.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Communication Style**:

- Collaborative and open to suggestions
- Thoughtful about implementation
- Asks clarifying questions
- Delegates technical evaluation to Egan
- Focused on team impact over personal features

**Decision-Making Approach**:

- Considers team needs first
- Seeks practical, scalable solutions
- Values proven functionality before rollout
- Relies on technical team members for evaluation
- Strategic about resource allocation

# Aggregated Insights

**Pain Points (November 6, 2025 Meeting)**:

1. Limited personal usage due to few customer calls
2. Uncertainty about manager-specific features
3. Need for visibility into team calls he's not on
4. Wants team coaching and development capabilities
5. Unclear on deployment path for broader team

**Goals (November 6, 2025 Meeting)**:

1. View and analyze calls from team members
2. Run coaching prompts on team conversations
3. Deploy across CS team with demonstrated value
4. Enable contact role classification (day-to-day, champion, etc.)
5. Improve team performance through better insights

**Tools Ecosystem**:

- Call Recording: Gong (considering integration)
- CRM: Salesforce (implied through contact tagging discussion)
- Current evaluation: AskElephant

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**What Works**:

- Focus on manager-specific value propositions
- Demonstrate team visibility features clearly
- Show coaching workflow capabilities
- Provide concrete use cases (contact tagging)
- Address scalability and team adoption early

**What Doesn't Work**:

- Individual contributor features won't resonate
- Assuming high personal call volume
- Pushing for expansion without addressing Egan's concerns
- Ignoring the team's technical evaluation process

**Recommended Next Steps**:

1. Set up manager-specific workflows (team call analysis)
2. Enable coaching prompts for calls Andy isn't on
3. Create contact role tagging workflow with Egan
4. Provide clear team adoption playbook
5. Regular check-ins on team usage and value
6. Address technical concerns Egan raised before broad rollout

# Key Quotes from November 6, 2025 Meeting

**Manager Visibility Needs**:

"Would I, as a manager, be able to, like, view calls and run these prompts for calls that I'm not on?"

**Practical Use Case**:

"One thing that would be, like, contact tagging, like, with CSM contact roles if there's an opportunity based on sort of their screen conversation, tag them as a day to day or champion or something like that."

**Limited Personal Usage**:

"I think I'll just start by saying my ability to use it so far has just been limited. I've had a limited number of customer calls."

**Quality Evaluation**:

"I did go through, like, the meeting summary, the coaching, the resource recommendation. I thought there was some interesting stuff in there."

**Team Deployment Consideration**:

"Let's say this was deployed across our whole CS team. Would I, as a manager, be able to..."

# Implementation Notes

**Current Status**: Early evaluation phase with limited personal usage

**Decision Influencers**: Egan Callahan (technical evaluation), Andy Stone (team fit and value)

**Deployment Blockers**: Technical issues Egan identified must be resolved first

**Success Criteria**: Manager visibility, team coaching capabilities, contact tagging automation

**Next Meeting Focus**: Demo manager-specific features, address Egan's technical concerns, establish pilot use case
