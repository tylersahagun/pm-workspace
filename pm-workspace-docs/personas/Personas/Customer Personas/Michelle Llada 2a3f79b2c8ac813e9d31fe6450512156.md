Tools Mentioned: AskElephant
Traits That Don't Match: • Limited visibility into strategic decision-making in this meeting
• Not showing operational pain points typically associated with Odis persona
• More passive role in this interaction than expected for Operations persona
Traits That Match: • Operational focus - handles setup and coordination tasks
• Takes direction from leadership (Reef Colman)
• Facilitates team processes and software implementation
• Professional communication style
Validation Notes: First meeting observation (Nov 6, 2025). Michelle appears to be in an operational/coordination role within WeAssist team. She takes direction from Reef Colman (who appears to be the decision maker) and was designated to handle the screen sharing and technical setup. Limited data from this brief introductory call - need additional meeting interactions to confirm persona match. Current assessment: 55% match with Odis (Operations), but could also show traits of Irina (Implementation) as the project progresses. Recommend observing her role in the follow-up Monday demo call.
Validation Status: Needs More Data
