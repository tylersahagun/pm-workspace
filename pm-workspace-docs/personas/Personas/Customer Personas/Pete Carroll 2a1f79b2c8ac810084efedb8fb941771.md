# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 4, 2025 - Expert consultation on Maker's Hub investment opportunity

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Roger (Revenue/Strategic Leader)

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Presented as Roger based on investment evaluation role, strategic thinking, and GTM-focused questions

**Why this classification**:
Pete Carroll demonstrates classic Roger characteristics as a venture capital investor evaluating a fintech opportunity. He approaches the conversation with strategic, revenue-focused thinking, asking about go-to-market strategy, competitive positioning, TAM analysis, and leadership quality. Like Roger, he values data-driven insights, seeks clarity on differentiation and scalability, and leverages his network for intelligence gathering. His comfort discussing technical concepts (OCR, payment arbitrage, basis points) while maintaining focus on business outcomes and commercial viability mirrors Roger's ability to bridge technical understanding with strategic revenue thinking. He explicitly states preference for "boring markets" with vulnerable incumbents that can be disrupted through better execution - a quintessentially Roger perspective on building predictable, sustainable growth.

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns Across Meetings:**

- Strategic, analytical approach to opportunity assessment
- Focus on go-to-market strategy over pure technology differentiation
- Values network intelligence and expert perspectives
- Asks probing questions about competitive moats and sustainable advantages
- Considers multiple stakeholders (founders, leadership teams, market incumbents)

**Communication Preferences (learned over time):**

- Direct, substantive conversation style
- Appreciates candid assessments over polished sales pitches
- Comfortable with back-and-forth dialogue and real-time analysis
- Values actionable insights and specific recommendations
- Prefers concrete examples and market intelligence over theoretical frameworks

# Strategic Engagement Playbook (Updated)

**Current Stage**: Network relationship / Potential future client

**What We've Learned Works:**

- Direct, candid feedback without corporate speak (Woody's blunt assessment of Bill.com resonated)
- Deep domain expertise demonstrating insider knowledge (Divvy experience added credibility)
- Specific, tactical insights rather than high-level generalizations
- Offering to make introductions to relevant experts (Bill.com/Divvy connections)
- Acknowledging complexity and red flags rather than overselling

**What to Avoid (learned from experience):**

- Generic advice or surface-level analysis
- Overpromising or downplaying legitimate concerns
- Purely technical discussions without business context
- Pushing toward specific conclusions rather than objective assessment

**Current Priorities:**

1. Due diligence on Maker's Hub investment opportunity
2. Understanding competitive landscape in AP/payment platforms
3. Evaluating go-to-market viability and distribution partnerships
4. Assessing leadership team quality and market positioning
5. Determining if boring/niche markets have sufficient TAM and defensibility

# Key Quotes Across All Meetings

**Meeting 1**: "I do like those boring markets. I do like the ones that we have a, you know, an incumbent that is very vulnerable and doesn't have great leadership... one can beat them. And then the momentum kind of, like, really shifts and there's it creates kinda tailwinds."
Context: Reveals investment philosophy - seeks opportunities where execution can overcome weak incumbents in overlooked markets

**Meeting 1**: "Is that differentiable over the long term? That's a totally right kind of question that we're trying to assess."
Context: Shows focus on sustainable competitive advantage, not just initial product superiority

**Meeting 1**: "Our instinct is not, like, slam dunk, like, that this area is super obvious. But... if you can do that, and we bet on companies that are explicitly doing that, maybe hotter, sexier markets per se."
Context: Indicates pattern recognition in investment approach - willing to invest in less obvious opportunities with right execution

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions/Blockers:**

# Next Steps & Recommendations

2. If appropriate for future AskElephant positioning: frame value proposition around eliminating due diligence blindspots and capturing expert knowledge
3. Stay connected as valuable network contact - Pete evaluates B2B SaaS deals and values expert insights
4. When appropriate, demonstrate how AskElephant could help Jump Capital capture/aggregate expert consultations like this one

**Watch for:**
