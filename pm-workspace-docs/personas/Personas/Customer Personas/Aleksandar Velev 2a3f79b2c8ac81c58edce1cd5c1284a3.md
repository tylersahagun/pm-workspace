• Evaluating tools for client deployment and internal use

• Tech-savvy, understands API integrations and webhooks

Validation Notes: Second meeting (Nov 13, 2025): LinkedIn strategy coaching session. Alex on AskElephant trial, first successful notetaker join. Upgraded persona classification from Operations Manager (75%) to Revenue Leader (85%) based on: founder role confirmation, revenue generation focus ($53M pipeline), client portfolio influence, strategic + tactical hybrid approach. Testing product with intent to recommend to client base. Committed to creating LinkedIn post about meeting. Strong partnership potential - acts as force multiplier through client recommendations. Shows Roger traits (strategic, revenue-focused, decision authority) with Aaron traits (hands-on prospecting, tactical execution). Custom CRM presents integration challenge but views as feature, not blocker.
Validation Status: ⚠️ Partial Match (60-79%)
