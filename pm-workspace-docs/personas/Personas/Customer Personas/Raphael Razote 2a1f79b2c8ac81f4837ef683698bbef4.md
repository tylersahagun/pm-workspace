# Meeting History

**Meeting 1**: November 4, 2025 - Implementation Review & Troubleshooting

- Purpose: Technical implementation review, workflow debugging, feature requests
- Attendees: Raphael (StudioHawk), Charbel (StudioHawk), Erika Vasquez (AE), Matt Bennett (AE)
- Duration: 37 minutes
- Role: Primary technical contact, led detailed walkthrough of issues and requirements

# Persona Validation Summary

**Primary Match**: Odis (Operations/RevOps) - 88% confidence

**Secondary Traits**: Shows 15% Irina (Implementation) traits due to onboarding/setup focus

**Classification Rationale**:
Raphael is a textbook Odis persona - the operations/RevOps professional responsible for system integrations, data hygiene, workflow optimization, and cross-functional alignment. He demonstrated classic Odis behaviors: detailed documentation of issues (3 main pain points enumerated), concern for data cleanliness ("we want to keep things clean"), managing platform integrations (HubSpot 14 AskElephant sync), and acting as liaison between technical needs and leadership decisions. His focus on quality-of-life features and competitive product research further confirms the Odis match.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Consistent Communication Patterns**:

- Systematic problem presentation: "We have three main pain points"
- Screen-sharing to visualize issues (demonstrates attention to clarity)
- Diplomatic escalation: Validates technical issues before deferring business decisions to Charbel
- Solution-oriented: "That's a good idea" when presented with workarounds
- User advocacy: Champions features that improve team experience

**Problem-Solving Approach**:

- Documents issues meticulously before meetings
- Provides concrete examples (test companies, contact sync issues)
- Researches competitive solutions (Fathom desktop app comparison)
- Tests functionality before escalating (delete button verification)
- Bridges technical and business perspectives

**Team Dynamics**:

- Reports to Charbel (decision maker)
- Interfaces between sales, CS, and leadership teams
- Advocates for end-user experience needs
- Manages vendor relationships at implementation level
- Translates leadership requirements into technical specifications

# Aggregated Insights

- Missing "day one" features (billing section)
- Workflows that don't account for team adoption realities
- Feature requests taking time to implement

**Recommended Engagement Strategy**:

1. **Technical Partnership Approach**:

    - Regular check-ins on technical issues
    - Beta access to new features relevant to his use case
    - Direct line to product/engineering for detailed feedback
2. **Documentation & Training**:

To leverage his influence:

- Make him successful in his role

- Advanced integration consulting
- Custom workflow development for their unique setup
- Beta testing program participation
- Reference customer relationship (he provides valuable feedback)
- Training sessions for CS team on AskElephant optimization

# Technical Implementation Notes

**Current Setup**:

- HubSpot 14 AskElephant integration active
- Three workflows configured: Sales-CS handoff, Meeting summary, Email sentiment
- Only meeting summary actively used
- Email sentiment replicated in-house (cost reasons)
- Sales-CS handoff blocked by sales team non-adoption

**Integration Challenges**:

1. One-to-one sync creates data clutter
2. No filtering by client status/lifecycle stage
3. Cannot delete synced records
4. Sales team using parallel HubSpot notetaker
5. Notes not flowing back to HubSpot

**Proposed Technical Solutions**:

1. **Selective Sync**: Filter HubSpot companies by status (Active clients only)
2. **Bidirectional Notes**: Push AskElephant summaries to HubSpot notes field
3. **Record Management**: Enable deletion/archiving in AskElephant
4. **Desktop App Enhancement**: Auto-admit bot from waiting room
5. **Meeting Notifications**: Post-meeting summary auto-delivery

**Technical Advocacy**:
Raphael's feedback represents valuable product intelligence:

- Billing section visibility ("day one feature")
- Competitive feature gaps identified (Fathom desktop app)
- ROI reporting enhancement suggestion (from Charbel, validated by Raphael)
- User experience improvement opportunities
- Integration flexibility needs for diverse team structures
