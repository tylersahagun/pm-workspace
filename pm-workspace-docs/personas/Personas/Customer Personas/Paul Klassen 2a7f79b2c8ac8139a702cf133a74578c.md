Key Quotes: My my exposure is really elementary, so so it was very cool to kinda see how to summarize workflow, manage, utilize an AI tool... As part of the evolution of how to enhance progress flow going in 2026. You're gonna have to probably be more of a fly on the wall to understand a little bit from Ken in Brooklyn and then your your side, Maria.

Validation Notes: Paul appears to be a senior executive at PestShare (likely C-suite or VP-level) with oversight of the fulfillment function. This was his first exposure to AskElephant despite the team using it. He's taking an observational learning approach - wants to be included but defers scheduling to team needs. Focused on 2026 optimization and understanding how AI tools can enhance organizational workflow. Limited technical familiarity but strategic interest. Supportive leadership style that empowers team decision-making.
Validation Status: Partial Match
