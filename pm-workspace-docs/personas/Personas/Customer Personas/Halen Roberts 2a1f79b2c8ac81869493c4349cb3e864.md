# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 4, 2025 - Voicemail follow-up (no direct conversation)

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Tentatively Roger (Revenue/BD-focused) - **requires validation through actual conversation**

**Initial Classification Rationale**:

- Role: Business Development and Partnerships Manager at Skedda
- Focus on strategic partnerships and new business development
- Decision-making authority likely for vendor/tool selection in BD/revenue context
- Aligns with Roger's revenue-focused, strategic orientation

**Confidence Level**: LOW - Classification based solely on job title and role description from voicemail greeting. No actual behavioral data or conversation to validate.

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Observed Patterns:**

- **Responsiveness**: Currently non-responsive to outreach (voicemail left, no callback/reply yet)
- **Communication Setup**: Professional voicemail system with clear instructions - indicates organized approach
- **Preferred Contact**: Unknown - Mike offered LinkedIn DM as alternative to phone callback
- **Decision Stage**: Early prospecting - previous conversation referenced but no active engagement
- **AE Contact**: Mike Haimowitz ([mike@askelephant.ai](mailto:mike@askelephant.ai))

**Unknown Variables (Requires Future Meetings):**

- Communication style and personality
- Technical sophistication level
- Pain points and priorities
- Decision-making process and authority

# Strategic Engagement Playbook (Draft)

**Current Stage**: Cold/Warm Prospect - Early Outreach Phase

**Outreach History:**

- Multiple touchpoints attempted by Mike
- LinkedIn connection established ("guy from LinkedIn")
- Voicemail left November 4, 2025 at 12:47 PM MST
- No response to date

**Mike's Approach (Observed):**

- Persistent but respectful follow-up style
- Informal, friendly tone
- Gives prospect clear control options:
    1. State it's not relevant now
    2. State it's never relevant
    3. Schedule a demo
- Prefers async communication (LinkedIn DM) over phone tag
- Humorous but professional ("until one of us dies")

**Recommended Next Steps:**

1. Send LinkedIn DM as promised (Mike committed to this)
2. Provide clear value proposition specific to BD/partnerships role
3. Reference previous conversation to establish continuity
4. Keep barrier to engagement low (short call vs. full demo)
5. Watch for response patterns to gauge communication preferences

**What We Don't Know Yet:**

- Why Halen initially engaged (previous conversation referenced)
- What changed between first touch and current silence
- Whether timing is the issue or fit/relevance
- Who else might be involved in evaluation
- What their current process/tool stack looks like
- Specific pain points in their BD/partnerships workflow

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Immediate Actions:**

1. ✅ Mike to send LinkedIn DM as promised (committed in voicemail)
2. In DM, ask qualifying questions:
    - "What initially interested you when we first connected?"
    - "Has anything changed in your BD/partnerships workflow priorities?"
    - "Are you the right person to discuss tools that help partnerships teams track conversations and context?"

**Discovery Priorities for Next Interaction:**

1. Understand Halen's specific role and responsibilities
2. Identify current pain points in BD/partnerships workflow
3. Determine if AskElephant's context-tracking/handoff capabilities align with their needs
4. Assess decision-making process and timeline
5. Identify other stakeholders involved
6. Validate persona classification through actual conversation

**Watch For:**

- Response time and channel preference (LinkedIn vs. phone vs. email)
- Engagement level with DM - does Halen ask questions or just acknowledge?
- Whether Halen mentions specific problems/challenges without prompting
- Any urgency indicators or timeline mentions
- References to current tools or processes they're using

**Risk Factors:**

- Extended non-responsiveness could indicate low priority or poor fit
- If no response to LinkedIn DM, may need to disqualify or pause outreach
- Unclear if previous conversation established any genuine interest or just polite engagement

# Persona Flexibility Note

⚠️ **TENTATIVE CLASSIFICATION** - Current Roger assignment is based solely on job title and role description. Actual persona could be:

- **Roger** if Halen is focused on revenue partnerships, strategic deals, and executive-level engagements
- **Aaron** if Halen is more transactional in partnership sales with quota-driven focus
- **Odis** if role has significant operational/technical integration components
- **Irina** if focused on partner onboarding and implementation coordination
- **Celine** if managing ongoing partner relationships and success

**Validation Required**: First actual conversation will be critical for accurate persona assignment. Pay attention to:

- How Halen describes their role and daily priorities
- What problems they mention first
- Their communication style and decision-making approach
- Technical sophistication level
- Strategic vs. tactical orientation
