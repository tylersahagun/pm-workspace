# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 3, 2025 - Partnership Role Interview/Discovery Call with Robert Henderson

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Aaron (Account Executive) with emerging Roger (Revenue Leader) traits

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Presents primarily as Aaron - entrepreneurial AE seeking ownership and creation opportunities, but shows Roger tendencies in strategic thinking about market expansion and building scalable processes

**Why this classification**:
Josh embodies Aaron's core traits as a hustling, achievement-driven sales professional who values autonomy and hates administrative burden. However, unlike typical Aarons, he demonstrates Roger-level strategic thinking about building systems, owning territories, and creating scalable processes. His entrepreneurial background (custom suits, farmer's market distribution) and desire to "create something that wouldn't be as good if I wasn't there" shows Aaron's achievement drive combined with Roger's systems-building mentality. Currently operating as an AE but clearly positioned for revenue leadership trajectory.

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns Across Meetings:**

- Deep need for ownership and autonomy - not just territory ownership but creative ownership
- Builder/creator mentality: "another word I think I'd use for that is almost like creation"
- Previously burned out from entrepreneurial ventures (2-3 all-nighters weekly, "almost traumatic")
- Strategic about resource allocation and autonomy - skeptical of Netgain's ability to give him true ownership
- Values creation over quotas: "I'm motivated by a quota, but that's not my primary motivation"
- Responds well to direct challenges and high expectations (Woody's "unlock true potential" feedback still drives him)

**Evolution/Changes Noticed:**

- Initially frustrated with Netgain's lack of support in Australia  Reframed as ownership opportunity and "started to absolutely love it"
- Created partner-based support system when US team unavailable (process innovation)
- Moving from pure execution (AE) toward strategic ownership (territory/region management)
- Rebuilding appetite for startup chaos after Deloitte/Divvy/Netgain safety

**Communication Preferences (learned over time):**

- Appreciates depth and challenging questions - responds well when pushed ("Please" when Robert asked to go deeper)
- Values authenticity and transparency over polish
- Engages fully when discussing ownership, creation, and potential
- Best meeting context: Career/opportunity discussions vs tactical sales calls
- Thoughtful, self-aware responses - takes time to articulate internal motivations

# Strategic Engagement Playbook (Updated)

**Current Stage**: Active Candidate - Partnership Relationship Manager Role

**What We've Learned Works:**

- Challenge him on his "why" - he appreciates depth and doesn't shy from hard questions
- Frame opportunities as "creation" and "ownership" not just "hitting quota"
- Reference Woody's previous feedback about unlocking potential (still resonates 5+ years later)
- Acknowledge the chaos/grind but emphasize the building opportunity
- Connect to his entrepreneurial past without triggering burnout memories
- Partnership channel aligns with his Netgain experience and interest

**What to Avoid (learned from experience):**

- Don't oversell just the "startup chaos" - he's been traumatized by all-nighters before
- Avoid positioning role as purely execution/quota-driven (he needs creation component)
- Don't treat him like a typical AE - he's thinking at a higher strategic level
- Don't promise autonomy without substance - he's been burned by Netgain's empty promises

**Evolving Priorities:**

1. Meeting 1 Priority: Understanding if AskElephant offers genuine ownership vs Netgain's potential 2-year Australia opportunity
2. Key Decision Factors:
    - Will he have budget, resources, and decision-making authority?
    - Is this a role where he can "create something that wouldn't be as good if I wasn't there"?
    - Will this help him unlock his true potential (Woody's challenge still lives in his head)?
    - Can he build toward eventual business ownership without burning out again?

# Key Quotes Across All Meetings

**Meeting 1**: "I think when I think of ownership, another word I think I'd use for that is almost like creation... I can almost create something that maybe wouldn't be as good if I wasn't there."
Context: Core motivation - not just hitting numbers but building something uniquely valuable

**Meeting 1**: "It was, to be honest, a nightmare. Like, it was very it was almost traumatic."
Context: Describing 2-3 all-nighters per week during farmer's market startup - explains his hesitation about extreme startup grind

**Meeting 1**: "I seem like the kind of person that kind of like gets whatever I want in life but hasn't figured out how to like unlock my true potential yet."
Context: Woody's feedback from Divvy interview still haunts and guides him - this is a core driver

**Meeting 1**: "If you're the owner of something, like, you have to be an executor. Right? Because it's on your head. Right? Like, you're in charge of it. If you're not executing, then who is?"
Context: Understands the creator-executor duality that Robert emphasized as critical

**Meeting 1**: "The last thing I want is to come down here and just feel stuck for two years that I have no power to do anything."
Context: Trust issues with Netgain - they offered Australia territory but he doubts they'll give real authority

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions/Blockers:**

- Strong Champion: James (LDS mission companion in Thailand, known 10+ years)
- Strong Champion: Woody (former Divvy manager, knows Josh's potential, already interviewed him once before Australia move)
- Positive Connection: Robert (this interview went well, mutual Divvy connection)

**Decision Dynamics:**

- Authority level: Individual contributor currently but thinks like a leader
- Key influencers: James (trusted friend), Woody (mentor figure), wife (married, considering 2-year Australia commitment)
- Budget control: None currently, but this is exactly what he's seeking
- Decision timeline: Returning from Australia in December 2025, evaluating Netgain's 2-year offer vs AskElephant
- Competing offer: Netgain wants him back for 2 more years to own Australia/ANZ region

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on aggregate learnings:**

1. **Position as "Creator + Executor" opportunity**: Emphasize he'd be building the partnership motion, not just executing someone else's playbook
2. **Quantify the ownership**: Show exactly what budget, resources, and decision-making authority he'd have (unlike Netgain's vague promises)
3. **Connect to "unlocking potential"**: Frame this as the environment where Woody's challenge gets answered - this is where he discovers his ceiling
4. **De-risk the burnout concern**: Acknowledge it's hard but not "traumatic all-nighters" hard - emphasize sustainable intensity
5. **Leverage James relationship**: Have James share more details about the partnership team's autonomy and creation opportunities
6. **Timeline consideration**: He's deciding by December whether to re-commit to Netgain Australia for 2 years or make a move

**Watch for:**

- Burnout risk if intensity isn't managed - he has trauma from previous startup
- Trust issues - needs proof of real autonomy, not just promises
- Comparison to Netgain offer - they're offering geographic ownership which is concrete
- Partnership with spouse on big career decisions (married, relocated internationally)
- Whether "unlocking potential" drive is strong enough to overcome risk aversion from past failures

**Critical Success Factors:**

- Must genuinely give him creation authority (not just quota)
- Partnership channel fits his experience and interest perfectly
- Needs to see AskElephant's commitment to partner motion with resources, not just words
- Chemistry with James + Woody history are massive advantages
- Timing is tight - needs decision before December Australia return

# Persona Flexibility Note

Josh exhibits **Aaron's hustle, autonomy drive, and achievement orientation** but shows **Roger-level strategic thinking** about market ownership, process creation, and systems building. He's currently an AE but positioned for revenue leadership roles. Approach with Aaron's respect for autonomy and achievement but engage his Roger-side strategic thinking when discussing territory ownership, partnership strategy, and scalable process creation. His entrepreneurial background means he thinks like a founder trapped in an AE role - the partnership opportunity could be the bridge between these identities.

**Key Differentiator**: Unlike typical Aarons who avoid admin/process work, Josh actively seeks opportunities to build and own processes - this is his Roger emerging. He's not just chasing quota, he's building a territory/channel from scratch.
