• Values customization and flexibility
• Tech-savvy, understands API integrations and webhooks

Validation Notes: First meeting (Nov 6, 2025). Agency owner serving HubSpot/Salesforce clients. Strong technical understanding - immediately asked about API keys, webhooks, custom CRM integration. Primary interest: deploying AskElephant for clients (lead scoring, proposals, CRM automation, Slack notifications). Also exploring internal use but custom CRM creates integration challenges. Showed high interest in partner program (15% ARR commission). Requested 7-day trial and API documentation. Follow-up scheduled with integrations team (Tuesday). Match confidence 75% - exhibits strong Odis traits (operations, automation, technical) but agency/partner context creates unique variation. More strategic implementer than day-to-day operator.
Validation Status: ⚠️ Partial Match (60-79%)

# Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: Nov 6, 2025 - Initial discovery call with James Hinkson and Mike Haimowitz

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 75% match with Odis (Operations)

**Secondary Traits**: Shows 20% traits of Roger (Revenue Leader) due to agency ownership

**Classification Rationale**:

Aleksandar exhibits strong Odis characteristics: technical operations focus, automation-driven, building/customizing systems, API/webhook understanding, and solving workflow inefficiencies. However, his agency/partner context creates a unique variation - he's not purely an internal operator but rather implements solutions across multiple client organizations. His dual focus (internal operations + client deployments) and revenue generation through referrals adds strategic elements typically associated with revenue leadership.
