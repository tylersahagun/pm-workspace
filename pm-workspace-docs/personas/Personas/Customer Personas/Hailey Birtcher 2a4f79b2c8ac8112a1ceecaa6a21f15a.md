Validation Notes: INITIAL COLD CALL - INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR PERSONA MATCHING

This was a brief cold outreach call that ended prematurely before meaningful conversation could occur. Hailey confirmed her identity and employment but the call did not progress to discuss:
- Her role/title
- Whether they use HubSpot/Salesforce
- Pain points or business challenges
- Goals or objectives

RECOMMENDATION: Follow-up contact needed to gather persona validation data. Current confidence too low (15%) for any persona assignment.

NEXT STEPS:
1. Attempt reconnection to complete discovery
2. Determine if Hailey is the right contact or if referral needed
3. Establish platform usage (HubSpot/Salesforce)
4. Understand her role in organization
Validation Status: Insufficient Data
