Validation Notes: First implementation call with AskElephant. John is the clear decision maker for Foxfire Software's sales coaching implementation. He has a proprietary sales methodology and needs AI to scale his coaching across his sales team. He explicitly stated the main use case: real-time coaching for sales reps with reports sent to reps, managers, and himself. Secondary use case is sales rep performance ranking. John works with Jessica (Sterling Ventures Group) who handles his operational logistics. Weekly Monday meetings at 10 AM Pacific scheduled for iteration.
Validation Status: ✅ Strong Match (80-100%)
