Communication Style: Direct/Results-focused
Company: Customer.io
Decision Authority: Influencer
Detected Role: Operations/RevOps
Email: rebekah@customer.io
Key Quotes: "We are in a place where our hygiene does rely heavily on manual entry... and it doesn't happen often. And so, like, from a BDR perspective, we go to do, like, close loss campaigns or almost any campaign, and we have to figure out where when it meant, like, if something actually happened on the call, like, all that context isn't reliably there."

"What we're really trying to track down, like, as a business sales side right now is where our actual fall off is from, like, for the BDR side generating the op to losing it or winning it in the end."

"Trace and I are currently manually going through each call conducted and see what happened and if next steps were set."
