# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: 2025-11-04 - Initial discovery call / Product demo

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Odis (Operations) with Irina (Implementation) traits

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Presented primarily as **Odis** - the technical gatekeeper focused on integrations, workflow optimization, and data quality. Shows secondary **Irina** characteristics in his role as implementation evaluator who ensures smooth handoffs and system adoption.

**Why this classification**:
Jaime is the "tech person in the business" who conducts initial evaluations of new tools - a classic Odis role. His primary concerns throughout the call were:

1. **Integration quality with HubSpot** - "the integration with HubSpot's a bit choppy, to say the least" (referring to current tool Tactic)
2. **Workflow automation** - Interested in reducing manual intervention and ensuring data flows seamlessly
3. **Technical architecture** - Asked detailed questions about LLMs, local recording capabilities, bot functionality
4. **Data consistency** - The core problem he's solving is ensuring notes consistently get into HubSpot

However, he also shows Irina traits as someone responsible for:

- Evaluating tools that will affect the entire team (all 16 people across designers, developers, CSMs)
- Ensuring smooth handoffs between team members and clients
- Implementation feasibility and adoption concerns
- Bridging between technical capabilities and business needs

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns (Meeting 1):**

- **Technically sophisticated**: Uses coding tools (Cursor, Claude, various AI coding assistants), understands prompt engineering, immediately recognized LLM selection feature as valuable
- **References matter**: Repeatedly noted appreciation for grounded, referenced data - "I like references. It means that it's grounded, and it makes sense"
- **Integration quality obsessed**: Main pain point is current tool's "choppy" HubSpot integration requiring manual intervention
- **Efficiency-driven**: Focused on reducing manual work, avoiding "attrition" from bots joining meetings unnecessarily
- **Pragmatic evaluator**: Not easily impressed, focuses on practical functionality over flashy features

**Communication Preferences:**

- Direct and technical: Comfortable diving into LLM details, API integrations, workflow architecture
- Appreciates transparency: "I can't show it to John straight away because he'll get all excited, and he's a big child of toys"
- Values grounded data: Likes references and evidence
- Prefers demos over descriptions: "It'd be good to see what the platform [looks like]"
- Evening flexibility: Located in North Wales (UK), available for evening calls

# Strategic Engagement Playbook

**Current Stage**: Prospect - Initial evaluation phase (technical validation complete, moving to decision-maker)

**What We've Learned Works:**

- **Show, don't tell**: Jaime responded well to live demo and practical examples
- **Technical depth**: He appreciated being able to ask about LLMs, architecture, recording methods
- **Acknowledge limitations**: When local recording wasn't ready, James's transparency about development timeline was received positively
- **Reference integration quality**: Emphasizing HubSpot's recommendation and deep integration resonated strongly
- **Demonstrate workflow flexibility**: The customizable workflows and multi-LLM support impressed him

**What to Avoid:**

- Over-promising on features: He's seen tools that don't deliver - "most of them don't really push that information in properly"
- Overselling complexity: He mentioned not wanting to "overengineer" - keep scope manageable initially
- Ignoring their current stack: They use Tactic currently, so acknowledge what it does well vs. gaps

**Current Priorities:**

1. **HubSpot integration quality**: Seamless, automated data flow without manual intervention
2. **Note consistency**: Ensuring all team members' customer conversations get logged
3. **Transcription + insights**: Starting with basics, planning to expand to more advanced workflows
4. **Meeting recording flexibility**: Concerned about bot visibility on client calls using different platforms (Teams, Zoom, etc.)

**Decision Process:**

- Jaime evaluates technical fit and provides recommendation
- John (Managing Director) makes final commercial decision
- John is described as "very hard faced" - "he likes to make people sweat because he's a salesperson"
- Quick decision cycle - "it's just myself and then John" (no lengthy procurement)
- Partnership opportunity interest - they're a HubSpot Diamond partner who could refer clients

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions/Blockers:**

- **Champion**: Jaime himself - gave strong technical validation, said it's "promising bit of kit"
- **Decision Maker**: John (Managing Director) - described as tough negotiator who "knows what buttons to press"
- **Relationship**: Jaime and John have quick decision dynamic, Jaime provides technical recommendation

**Organizational Context:**

**Potential Partnership Angle:**

- Carmen Digital is HubSpot Diamond partner
- Jaime mentioned: "the partnership does sound interesting... there might be clients that we could be interested in pushing it going forward"
- This could be higher value than just a 16-seat customer deal

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on aggregate learnings:**

1. **For John meeting (scheduled next Wednesday 4PM UK time)**:
    - Prepare for tough commercial negotiation - John will press hard on pricing
    - Lead with partnership opportunity, not just customer opportunity
    - Emphasize HubSpot's strong relationship with AskElephant
    - Show clear ROI for 16-seat deployment
    - Have phased rollout option ready (start with John + 1 salesperson, then expand)
2. **Commercial strategy**:
    - Consider partner program incentives vs. standard pricing
    - Jaime indicated potential to refer clients - calculate partner LTV
    - Diamond partner status = high credibility in HubSpot ecosystem
    - Be prepared for "where is this coming from?" pricing transparency questions
3. **Technical follow-through**:
    - Jaime validated technical fit ✅
    - Local recording feature coming in "couple months" - provide timeline update
    - Emphasize can manually add bot to any meeting platform (Teams, Zoom) in <30 seconds
    - Multiple meeting type workflows (sales calls, sprint conversations, etc.) will resonate

**Watch for:**

- **Potential concern**: Timeline sensitivity around local recording - they prefer not having bot visible on client calls
- **Opportunity**: Partnership referral program could make this a strategic account beyond just 16 seats
- **Risk**: If John gets too excited about features Jaime hasn't validated, may need to manage scope expectations ("we don't wanna go crazy on it")

**Post-meeting actions taken:**

- Calendar invite sent for John demo (Wednesday 4PM UK / 9AM MST)
- Mike committed to sending follow-up email with meeting link

# Persona Flexibility Note

Jaime exhibits **Odis** as his dominant type (technical operations, integration-focused, systems thinker) but shows **Irina** traits when evaluating implementation feasibility and team adoption. Approach with Odis strategies (technical depth, integration quality, workflow automation) but be ready to address Irina concerns (ease of adoption, change management, ensuring team doesn't resist new tool) when discussing rollout plans.

His role bridges technical evaluation and implementation success - he needs both the system to work technically AND to work for his diverse team (designers, developers, CSMs, salespeople).
