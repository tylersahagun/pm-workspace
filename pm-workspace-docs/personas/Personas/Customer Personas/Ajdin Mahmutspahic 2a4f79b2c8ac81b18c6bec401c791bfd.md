# Meeting History

**Meeting 1**: Late 2024 - Initial demo focused on L&D and coaching capabilities

**Meeting 2**: November 7, 2025 - Reconnection call, shift to agentic AI and sales enablement focus. Xerox is in ideation phase for implementing AI agents across business functions, driven by leadership mandate to "go agentic."

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 78% match with **Odis (Operations/RevOps)**

**Secondary Traits**: Shows 30% traits of Irina (Implementation) in facilitator/coordination role

**Classification Rationale**:
Ajdin functions primarily as an Operations/RevOps evaluator tasked with identifying and vetting AI solutions for enterprise-wide sales enablement. His focus on reducing administrative overhead, improving forecasting, and implementing cross-functional automation aligns strongly with RevOps priorities. The technical depth of his questions (LLM models, agent orchestration, integration architecture) and his coordination of distributed "AI advocates" across business units demonstrates an operational/strategic technology evaluation role rather than end-user or pure implementation function.

The partial match (vs. strong match) reflects that he's in an evaluation/facilitation role rather than hands-on RevOps operations, and lacks typical RevOps concerns around data hygiene, dashboard optimization, or daily operational metrics.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Communication Approach**: Direct, transparent, and technically curious. Ajdin explicitly states when he's being candid about internal processes and constraints. He asks clarifying technical questions and wants to understand capabilities before committing.

**Decision-Making Style**: Methodical and committee-based. He's gathering information to bring back to Junaid (decision maker) and coordinate with AI advocates. Values transparency about process stage and timing constraints.

**Engagement Preferences**:

- Wants detailed technical information and use case examples
- Prefers group demos with stakeholders vs individual decisions
- Appreciates educational approach
- Values vendor patience and understanding of organizational constraints

# Aggregated Insights

**Pain Points (Priority Order)**:

1. **Administrative overhead** - Primary driver across conversation
2. **Manual CRM work** - Explicitly looking for automation
3. **Proactive revenue assurance** - Need better early warning systems
4. **Forecasting accuracy** - Improving predictability
5. **Customer retention** - Monitoring health and churn risk
6. **Lead conversion & sales cycle length** - Pipeline efficiency

**Goals Consistency**:

- **Primary**: Implement agentic AI to reduce manual work and increase productivity
- **Secondary**: Improve forecasting and revenue assurance
- **Tertiary**: Enable cross-sell opportunities across large organization

**Organizational Context**:

- Large enterprise (Xerox) with complex, siloed structure
- Currently undergoing Lexmark acquisition (delays timeline)
- Multiple stakeholders ("AI advocates") across business areas
- Leadership mandate to implement AI agents
- Looking at multiple vendors (Gong mentioned)

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**What Works**:
✅ Outcome-focused positioning (Woody led with this effectively)
✅ Live demos showing actual capability
✅ Transparency about pricing early
✅ Understanding timeline constraints without pressure
✅ Positioning as partner vs just tool vendor (consulting/implementation services)
✅ Technical depth when he asks for it

**What to Avoid**:
❌ Rushing decision or creating artificial urgency (he has real constraints)
❌ Single-stakeholder approach (needs group buy-in)
❌ Sales-only positioning (needs cross-departmental value)
❌ Glossing over integration complexity (he's technical enough to spot this)

**Key Competitive Advantages vs Gong**:

- Cross-departmental functionality (not just sales)
- Agent orchestration and customization
- LLM agnostic approach
- Consulting/implementation services included
- Better pricing model for their use case

# Next Steps Identified

**Immediate (Ajdin's actions)**:

1. Report back to Junaid with information from this call
2. Consolidate use cases from AI advocates across business units
3. Coordinate group demo with all stakeholders

**AskElephant Follow-up**:

1. Send meeting recording and additional use case examples
2. Provide competitive positioning vs Gong
3. Share technical integration documentation
4. Prepare for multi-stakeholder group demo (early 2026)

**Timeline**: Early 2026 implementation target due to Lexmark acquisition transition

**Deal Stage**: Early discovery/ideation 12 moving toward evaluation phase
