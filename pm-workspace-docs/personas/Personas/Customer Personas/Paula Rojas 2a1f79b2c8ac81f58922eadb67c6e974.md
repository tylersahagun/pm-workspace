# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 4, 2025 (4:00 PM MST) - Cold outreach call

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Odis (Operations) - Preliminary classification based on limited interaction

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Initial cold call showed Odis characteristics - professional gatekeeper with clear operational boundaries

**Why this classification**:
Paula demonstrated classic Operations persona traits during this brief interaction:

- Clear understanding of her scope of responsibility ("not in my ballpark")
- Efficient communication style with no wasted time
- Professional boundary-setting as organizational gatekeeper
- Quick assessment and decisive rejection of out-of-scope requests
- No exploration or curiosity about the offering, suggesting she operates within well-defined parameters

**Confidence Level**: 60-70% - This is a preliminary assessment based on a 71-second cold call rejection. More interactions needed to confirm persona classification or identify secondary traits.

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns Across Meetings:**

- Efficient, professional communication style
- Clear boundaries about what falls within her responsibility
- Acts as effective gatekeeper for School Mint
- Decisive and quick in assessment

**Communication Preferences (learned over time):**

- Direct, brief responses
- Appreciates clarity about purpose of call
- Values her time highly
- Professional but firm when declining

# Strategic Engagement Playbook (Updated)

**Current Stage**: Cold Prospect - Call Rejected

**What We've Learned:**

- Paula is NOT the right contact for Salesforce/HubSpot conversational intelligence offerings
- She has clearly defined responsibilities and doesn't explore outside her scope
- Cold calling her about sales/CRM tools is ineffective
- She functions as a gatekeeper, quickly assessing and routing/rejecting calls

**What to Avoid (learned from experience):**

- Don't cold call Paula about sales enablement or CRM tools
- Don't expect her to route calls to appropriate departments
- Don't attempt lengthy explanations - she makes quick decisions
- This contact path is not viable for AskElephant's offering

**Recommendations:**

1. Research School Mint's organizational structure to identify the correct stakeholder (likely RevOps, Sales Leadership, or CTO/VP of Technology)
2. If re-engaging School Mint, use different entry point (LinkedIn, referral, or different department contact)
3. Paula may be a valid contact for operational tooling related to her specific function, but not for GTM/sales tech

# Key Quotes Across All Meetings

**Meeting 1**: "Well, that that is yeah. That that's that's definitely not in my that's not my ballpark. So..."

Context: Clear and immediate rejection when presented with Salesforce/HubSpot conversational intelligence offering. This quote reveals her operational mindset - she has a defined "ballpark" and efficiently communicates when something falls outside it.

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions/Blockers:**

- Paula acts as a blocker for cold outreach attempts
- She is not hostile, simply efficient in gatekeeping
- No indication of who the correct stakeholder would be within School Mint

**Decision Dynamics:**

- Authority level: Has authority to reject outreach that's outside her scope
- Not a decision-maker for sales/GTM tooling
- Operates within defined operational boundaries

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on learnings:**

1. **Do NOT re-engage Paula** about AskElephant unless the offering shifts to operational tooling relevant to her specific function
2. **Research School Mint** to identify:
    - VP of Sales / CRO
    - Head of Revenue Operations
    - Director of Sales Enablement
    - CTO or VP of Technology
3. **Use alternative entry strategy**: LinkedIn outreach, referral network, or targeted campaigns to correct stakeholder
4. **Note for team**: Paula Rojas is not the economic buyer or user for conversational intelligence/CRM automation tools

**Watch for:**

- If School Mint becomes an active prospect through different channels, Paula may be valuable for operational coordination during implementation
- Paula's operational efficiency could be an asset if properly engaged within her scope of responsibility

# Persona Flexibility Note

This is a preliminary Odis classification with moderate confidence (60-70%). Paula exhibited clear operational/gatekeeper traits, but the brief interaction (71 seconds) limits our ability to identify secondary persona traits or deeper behavioral patterns.

**Need for validation:**

- Additional interactions would help confirm Odis classification
- Could reveal secondary traits (potentially Celine if she supports customer operations, or other operational specializations)
- Her specific role at School Mint remains unclear from this single interaction

**Operational context missing:**

- What is Paula's actual title and department?
- What ARE the tools/topics in "her ballpark"?
- Does she have influence over other operational decisions?

This entry should be updated significantly if/when more context becomes available.
