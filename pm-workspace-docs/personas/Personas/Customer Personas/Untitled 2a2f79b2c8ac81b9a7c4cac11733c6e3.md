Traits That Don't Match: • More strategic/leadership level than typical Odis persona

• Systems integrator mindset (Salesforce, Asana, Slack workflows)
• Focused on team enablement and reducing manual work
• Strong emphasis on measurement and tracking (churn reports, pipeline metrics)
• Takes ownership of implementation and testing
Validation Notes: Clayton demonstrates strong Odis (Operations) traits with significant Roger (Revenue Leader) characteristics. He's orchestrating a multi-team AskElephant rollout across Sales and CS teams. CS Team: Setting up 2 licenses for Director Chris Gika and AM Ali Sanchez for sentiment analysis and churn alerts. Sales Team: Salesforce workflows for lead enrichment, executive summaries, churn reports, pipeline metrics. Integration Strategy: Launching Asana, configuring Slack, 2-day SLA for workflows. Metrics Focus: WBR with opportunity tracking, MRR pipeline, churn reporting. Primary champion with clear timelines. Decision Maker with operational execution skills and strategic awareness.
Validation Status: ✅ Strong Match (80-100%)

# Meeting History

**Meeting 1: November 5, 2025** - Teikametrics | AskElephant CSM Roadmap

- Context: Initial CS team rollout planning and Salesforce workflow brainstorming
- Focus: Implementing AskElephant for both Sales and CS teams
- Key Stakeholders Identified: Chris Gika (Director, US CS team), Ali Sanchez (Account Manager)

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 85% match with **Odis (Operations)**

**Secondary Traits**: Shows 60% traits of **Roger (Revenue Leader)**

**Classification Rationale**:

Clayton Blackwell represents a hybrid Operations/Revenue Leader persona. While his primary function aligns with Odis (managing implementation, workflow configuration, system integration), he demonstrates significant strategic oversight typical of Roger personas. He's not just executinghe's architecting a cross-functional rollout strategy with clear business metrics and timeline management.

Key differentiators:

- Owns WBR metrics and pipeline reporting (Roger trait)
- Manages both Sales AND CS team rollouts (expanded Odis scope)
- Direct decision-making authority on licenses and implementation
- Fiscal year awareness and Q4 goal alignment
- Balances tactical execution with strategic business outcomes

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Consistent Patterns** (from this meeting):

- **Phased rollout approach**: 2-week pilot with specific users before broader deployment
- **Metrics-driven mindset**: Immediately discusses WBRs, pipeline metrics, churn reports
- **Systems thinking**: Connects workflows across Salesforce, Slack, Asana
- **Self-sufficiency orientation**: Wants to learn AI builder and workflow requests
- **Team enablement focus**: Prioritizes getting teams what they need to succeed

**Decision-Making Style**:

- Methodical: Tests with 1-2 people before scaling
- Collaborative: Weekly check-ins, mentions getting team buy-in
- Timeline-conscious: Planning around Thanksgiving milestone
- Risk-aware: Uses conditional approaches ("if they're receptive, we could test")

# Aggregated Insights

**Pain Points (by priority)**:

1. **Manual processes** - Multiple mentions of wanting to automate CRM updates, lead enrichment, contact enrichment
2. **Team alignment** - Managing rollout across Sales + CS teams with different needs
3. **Data visibility** - Building WBRs, wants churn reports, pipeline tracking, sentiment analysis
4. **Tool fragmentation** - Integrating Salesforce, Slack, Asana, AskElephant
5. **Time constraints** - Q4 pressure, Thanksgiving deadline, wants 2-day SLA clarity
6. **Adoption challenges** - Just transitioned from old tool, testing workflows with specific users

**Goals Consistency**:

- **Primary**: Scale operations across multiple teams efficiently
- **Primary**: Enable data-driven decision making (WBRs, metrics, reports)
- **Secondary**: Improve team efficiency and reduce manual work
- **Secondary**: Smooth handoffs between Sales and CS
- **Emerging**: Leverage AI/automation for self-service capabilities

**Tools & Integration Strategy**:

- **Current**: Salesforce (user-level connected), Slack (churn alerts configured)
- **Launching**: Asana integration for CS team
- **Planned**: Workspace-level Salesforce for workflows
- **Interested In**: Google Sheets/Drive (mentioned as upcoming)
- **Adoption Stage**: Just transitioned entire team to AskElephant from previous tool

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**What Works** (proven approaches):

- ✅ Clear SLA commitments (2-day turnaround resonated strongly)
- ✅ Self-service options (workflow request chat, AI builder excited him)
- ✅ Concrete use cases (lead enrichment, executive summaries, churn alerts)
- ✅ Phased approach that respects his pilot methodology
- ✅ Technical depth without overwhelming (explained integrations clearly)

**What Doesn't** (avoid):

- ❌ Rushing full deployment without pilot validation
- ❌ Assuming he needs hand-holding (he wants independence)
- ❌ Generic solutions (he has specific workflows in mind)

**Engagement Strategy**:

- Empower his self-sufficiency with workflow builder training
- Provide concrete examples from other customers
- Be specific about SLAs and timelines
- Offer proactive support but let him drive
- Connect him with technical resources (Tyler for integrations)
