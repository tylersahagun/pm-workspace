# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 3, 2025 - Weekly AskE x Motivosity Sync

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Celine (The Implementer)

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Clearly demonstrates Celine characteristics through tactical focus, execution ownership, and operational concerns

**Why this classification**:
Tom exhibits all the hallmarks of a Celine persona - he's the person who makes things happen on the ground. Throughout the meeting, he consistently took ownership of action items without being asked ("I'll just go explore", "I'll just set up the team"). He's focused on practical execution rather than high-level strategy, working directly with AEs on technical implementation details. His concern about user seat billing and cost management shows he's thinking about operational efficiency. He manages day-to-day team activities (mentioned team golfing for new employee welcome) and is comfortable getting his hands dirty with workflows and technical configurations.

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns Across Meetings:**

- Takes immediate ownership of action items and next steps
- Focuses on practical, tactical execution over strategic discussion
- Comfortable working directly in the product on workflows and configurations
- Manages internal team coordination and logistics
- Cost-conscious and operationally minded
- Collaborative and solution-oriented communication style

**Communication Preferences:**

- Casual, friendly tone with vendors
- Appreciates direct, practical conversations
- Prefers action-oriented discussions over theoretical planning
- Comfortable with informal check-ins (mentions chatting on Thursday, casual weekend conversation)

# Strategic Engagement Playbook

**Current Stage**: Established Customer - Implementation/Optimization Phase

**What We've Learned Works:**

- Give him autonomy and control over prioritization decisions
- Present options and let him decide what's most time sensitive
- Focus on practical examples and concrete deliverables (RFP examples, workflow templates)
- Be flexible about timelines and realistic about team capacity (acknowledged nothing happened Friday)
- Provide technical specifics when discussing capabilities (Google Suite integration details)

**What to Avoid:**

- Don't push for immediate decisions when team hasn't had time to discuss
- Avoid adding complexity or surprise costs (sensitive to billing issues)
- Don't bypass him on team resource decisions (wants to manage through proper channels like Doris)

**Current Priorities:**

1. **Workflow Development**: Contact enrichment, deal analysis, RFP generation workflows
2. **RFP Automation**: Gathering examples and figuring out format/integration requirements
3. **Integration Expansion**: Google Suite integration for Drive and Sheets access
4. **Cost Management**: Ensuring proper user seat management and avoiding unnecessary charges
5. **Close Lost Workflow**: Ongoing refinement based on real-world testing

# Key Quotes Across All Meetings

**Meeting 1**: "I'll just go explore. Like, two parts for me is, like, hey. Is there a central place with our past RFPs? Because that will help provide answers. And then, uh, send me your most recent RFPs so we can see what they look like coming into you."
Context: Perfect example of his implementer mindset - immediately breaking down the problem into actionable research tasks he'll personally execute.

**Meeting 1**: "We had that meeting Thursday afternoon, and then hardly anybody worked on Friday. So, basically, nothing's happened here."
Context: Realistic and transparent about team capacity and progress. Doesn't overpromise or make excuses.

**Meeting 1**: "I think he was worried that some people were just adding users and then we were getting charged for users. Like, he's like, don't know why we're adding these users."
Context: Shows his operational awareness and sensitivity to cost management issues within the organization.

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions/Blockers:**

- Reports to or works closely with: Doris (who controls user access decisions)
- Manages/coordinates with: AE team (mentions sitting with AEs on RFPs)
- Team members: Mark Evans (workflow collaborator), Christopher Wood (involved in team decisions)
- Team culture: Casual, collaborative (golf outings for new employees)

**Decision Dynamics:**

- Authority level: High operational authority for tool implementation and workflow decisions
- Key influencers: Needs to coordinate through Doris for resource/billing decisions
- Budget control: Influence - aware of costs and manages accordingly but doesn't have final budget authority
- Implementation control: Direct - owns the day-to-day execution

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on aggregate learnings:**

1. **Collect RFP Examples**: Tom committed to exploring internal RFP storage and collecting recent examples from the team. Follow up mid-week to see what he's found and offer to help organize/structure the information.
2. **Prioritize Workflows Together**: Since the team didn't have time to prioritize between contact enrichment, deal analysis, and RFP workflows, schedule a brief sync to help him think through priorities based on impact vs. effort.
3. **Google Suite Integration Timeline**: Keep him updated on Google Suite integration progress since he's planning around this capability for RFP automation. Set expectation of end-of-year delivery.
4. **Close Lost Workflow Monitoring**: Continue gathering feedback on the close lost workflow refinements. He appreciates the iterative improvement approach.
5. **Proper User Management**: Always go through Doris for new user seat requests to respect their internal process and cost controls.

**Watch for:**

- Team capacity constraints (Friday was a non-work day, team does golf outings) - be flexible with timelines
- Cost sensitivity - always be transparent about user seat implications
- Integration dependencies - he's building workflows that depend on future Google Suite capabilities
- Internal process changes - new employee onboarding may create new workflow needs

# Persona Flexibility Note

Tom is a pure Celine persona - the hands-on implementer who executes and makes things work. No secondary persona traits observed. His entire approach is tactical, operational, and execution-focused. He's the perfect customer contact for workflow optimization, technical implementation, and day-to-day product usage questions. For strategic/budget discussions, he'll likely need to involve others (like Doris).
