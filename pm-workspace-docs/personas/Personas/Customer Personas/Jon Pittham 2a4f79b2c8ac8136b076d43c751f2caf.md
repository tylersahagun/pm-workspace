# Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: November 7, 2025 - Initial AskElephant demo with Mike Canova (30 min intro call)

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 92% match with Roger (Revenue Leader)

**Secondary Traits**: Shows 35% traits of Aaron (AE) due to hands-on pre-sales work

**Classification Rationale**:

Jon is a textbook Roger persona despite leading a smaller consultancy. As CEO, his primary concerns are executive visibility, team performance, revenue protection, and operational efficiency. He explicitly requested weekly summaries across all team conversations, churn alerts, and visibility into at-risk vs upsell opportunities. His frustration with manual CRM hygiene and time spent on administrative tasks (follow-ups, refamiliarization) are classic Roger pain points.

# Key Pain Points (Detailed)

1. **Manual CRM Updates** - Only 50% of team logs activities consistently into HubSpot
2. **Executive Visibility Gaps** - Needs oversight across all 18 team members' conversations
3. **Time on Admin Tasks** - Spends significant time creating next steps and follow-ups
4. **Context Loss** - Has to refamiliarize himself with clients before each meeting
5. **Workshop Data Conversion** - Struggles converting unstructured workshop notes into proposals and user stories
6. **Risk Identification** - No proactive system to identify at-risk clients

# Primary Goals

1. **Weekly Executive Summary** - All conversations across teams with key insights
2. **Automated Task Creation** - Eliminate manual follow-up creation
3. **Churn/Risk Alerts** - Proactive identification of at-risk clients
4. **Upsell Opportunity Detection** - Surface expansion opportunities
5. **Team CRM Hygiene** - Ensure consistent activity logging

**Blockers/Considerations**:
