# Cole (Sales Rep)

AE Contact: Mike Canova
Communication Style: Technical/Detail-oriented
Company: The PEO Link (PEO Brokerage Firm)
Decision Authority: Influencer
Detected Role: Account Executive
Key Quotes: I think the biggest issue, especially because we're going through such rapid growth... One of the value adds for this is, yes, cleaning up data, cleaning up the pipeline for our sales reps and our franchisees. It's also we're trying to eliminate some of that administrative burden because right now, we're having to manually go and create all of these same functionalities that you're using today, all these custom fields. You know, we spent six, eight months building our HubSpot from the ground up.

Validation Notes: Cole is a partial match for Aaron (AE) persona at 75% confidence. While he identifies as a sales rep and understands front-line sales challenges, his role in this meeting was more operational/advisory than typical quota-carrying AE.

Key indicators supporting Aaron match: Sales rep role, concerned with administrative burden, interested in efficiency gains, understands CRM challenges.

Gaps from Aaron persona: Less focused on personal quota attainment, more focused on system architecture and team-wide implementation, acting as technical advisor rather than primary end-user.

Cole appears to be a hybrid role - likely a senior sales rep or team lead who understands both sales execution and operational requirements. His involvement suggests Charles values front-line input in technology decisions.

Decision-making authority: Influencer - brought in to provide sales team perspective and technical evaluation, but not the final decision maker.
Validation Status: ⚠️ Partial Match (60-79%)
