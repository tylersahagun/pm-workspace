# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 3, 2025 - LinkedIn strategy consultation and AskElephant discovery

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Aaron (Account Executive) - Primary persona

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Clearly presents as Aaron persona based on role (Enterprise AE), communication style, challenges with lead generation, practical approach to LinkedIn, and focus on efficiency over sophistication

**Why this classification**:
Brandon exhibits classic Aaron traits throughout this consultation:

- **Role alignment**: Enterprise AE for 1.5 years in a highly transactional industry (industrial cleaning supplies/maintenance products)
- **Achievement-driven mindset**: "If they can even get me one or two extra deals, why not?" - focused on tangible outcomes
- **Practical, action-oriented**: Immediately asks tactical questions, challenges ideas constructively, seeks what actually works
- **Limited tech/CRM infrastructure**: "We don't even use a CRM. We just use Teams" - minimal technology stack
- **High volume, relationship-based selling**: Cold calling is #1 channel, phone calls over meetings with busy maintenance managers
- **Direct communication style**: "I wanna be honest with you. I don't wanna waste your time" - refreshingly candid
- **Competitive/sports mindset**: League of Legends reference, appreciation for challenging/testing ideas
- **Time-conscious and efficiency-focused**: Interested in LinkedIn tactics that deliver incremental wins without massive time investment

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns Across Meetings:**

- **Honest and direct communicator**: Brandon consistently demonstrates transparency ("To be honest with you, I don't think they'd be interested"), values candor, and appreciates when others are straightforward
- **Intellectually curious with healthy skepticism**: Asks probing questions ("So the fifth or sixth, seventh follow-up. Right? What would you see your response rate is on those?"), challenges assumptions thoughtfully
- **Pragmatic decision-maker**: Evaluates tools/tactics through lens of "will this get me 1-2 extra deals?" rather than perfectionism
- **Relationship-preservation aware**: Understands nuances like "their ego is gonna be hurt, and they're gonna say, I'm not working with them no matter what" when discussing aggressive follow-up
- **Industry constraints shape behavior**: Works in tough environment where maintenance managers have minimal LinkedIn presence, limited buying authority, and prefer phone calls over meetings

**Evolution/Changes Noticed:**

- N/A - First meeting

**Communication Preferences (learned over time):**

- Prefers casual, authentic conversations over formal presentations (personal email, informal setting acknowledged upfront)
- Appreciates being challenged and testing ideas through dialogue
- Values tactical, actionable advice over theoretical frameworks
- Responds well to examples and demonstrations (screen sharing of LinkedIn tactics)
- Quick to clarify when something doesn't fit his context ("A lot of maintenance managers, they may not be on there")

# Strategic Engagement Playbook (Updated)

**Current Stage**: Prospect - Discovery/consultation completed, not qualified for AskElephant (lead generation need vs. call analysis solution)

**What We've Learned Works:**

- **Tactical, show-don't-tell approach**: Screen sharing LinkedIn tactics resonated strongly - "This is actually very helpful"
- **Acknowledging fit concerns upfront**: Brandon appreciated that Jamis didn't push when the solution wasn't right fit
- **Providing value regardless of sale**: LinkedIn coaching consultation created goodwill and future opportunity
- **Respecting his honesty**: When Brandon said it wouldn't be right fit, Jamis accepted gracefully and kept door open
- **Demonstrating the product concretely**: Walking through actual AskElephant interface generated genuine interest, even if timing wasn't right

**What to Avoid (learned from experience):**

- **Don't oversell when infrastructure isn't there**: Brandon's company lacks basic CRM - AskElephant would be several steps too advanced
- **Don't ignore stated priorities**: He clearly said "struggling with leads" is the main problem, not call quality/coaching
- **Don't push for meetings when he's clearly communicated "no"**: Risk damaging the positive relationship built

**Evolving Priorities:**

1. **Meeting 1 Priority**: LinkedIn lead generation tactics - wants to improve from baseline (connect + message only)
2. **Secondary interest**: Tools that could help, but only if they solve the lead problem
3. **Hidden opportunity**: When/if company adds CRM or solves lead gen challenge, AskElephant becomes much more relevant

# Key Quotes Across All Meetings

**Meeting 1**: "Definitely, the highest success rate is cold calling in, you know, this field or if you can go to shows. You know? You know, because that's where a lot of the maintenance guys go. They go to the shows."

**Context**: Demonstrates Brandon's clear understanding of his ICP and what channels actually work in industrial maintenance sector. LinkedIn is experimental/supplementary, not primary channel.

**Meeting 1**: "If you message somebody, like, six, seven, eight times and they're the decision maker and they block you, even if their team likes it, like, let's say you followed up with somebody else in the company and they like it, that person, you know and they they're human. A lot of times, they don't care about the company. Their ego is gonna be hurt, and they're gonna say, I'm not working with them no matter what."

**Context**: Shows sophisticated understanding of relationship dynamics and organizational politics. Brandon thinks strategically about long-term account relationships, not just individual touchpoints.

**Meeting 1**: "To be honest with you, I don't think they'd be interested in it because the main problem they're having, instead of you know, this is great for a company who's, like, doing good with leads and things like that. We're really, really struggling with leads."

**Context**: Perfect encapsulation of Aaron persona - direct, self-aware about company challenges, respectful of others' time, and clear on priorities. Also shows he understood AskElephant's value prop but correctly identified the mismatch.

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions/Blockers:**

- Brandon is an individual contributor AE without apparent buying authority
- His company leadership is focused on lead generation challenges over sales enablement/coaching tools
- No indication of champions for tools like AskElephant currently
- Brandon himself is positive toward AskElephant conceptually but correctly assessed it doesn't solve his company's immediate pain

**Decision Dynamics:**

- **Authority level**: Low - would need to advocate to leadership, and they're focused elsewhere
- **Key influencers**: Unknown - would need to understand his sales leadership and their priorities
- **Budget control**: None directly - company "has the worst CRM in the world" (no CRM), suggesting limited investment in sales tech stack

**Industry Context:**

- Industrial/commercial cleaning supplies and maintenance products
- Enterprise accounts but with operational buyers (maintenance managers, not executive buyers)
- High-volume, transactional sales model with long relationship cycles
- Buyers are extremely busy (5 people running million sq ft buildings), prefer phone calls, minimal LinkedIn presence
- Trade shows are major channel ("that's where a lot of the maintenance guys go")
- Challenge is not better cleaner/better price, but finding differentiation and building relationships to displace incumbents

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on aggregate learnings:**

1. **Stay connected on LinkedIn** - Brandon will now be implementing the 15-15-10-1 strategy (15 comments, 15 DMs, 10 follow-ups, 1 post daily). Monitor his activity and engage with his content to stay top of mind
2. **Provide occasional LinkedIn coaching touchpoints** - Share relevant posts, comment on his activity, offer quick tips. Build relationship as trusted advisor without sales pressure
3. **Monitor for infrastructure changes** - If Brandon's company ever implements proper CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot), that's the trigger to re-engage about AskElephant
4. **Watch for Brandon's career moves** - If he moves to a company with better sales tech infrastructure and lead flow (where call quality becomes the differentiator), he'd be ideal warm lead
5. **Potential referral source** - Brandon is networked in sales community (LinkedIn persona building), could refer AskElephant to others in better-fit situations

**Watch for:**

- **LinkedIn activity increase**: If Brandon starts posting/commenting regularly, engage consistently to deepen relationship
- **Company changes at his org**: New sales leadership, CRM implementation, shift from lead gen to conversion focus
- **Brandon's frustration signals**: If lead gen problem persists and he starts looking for other efficiency gains, that's re-engagement opportunity
- **Career movement**: Brandon as AE at different company with better infrastructure = hot lead

**Timing considerations:**

- Don't reach out for sales conversation for at least 3-6 months unless he initiates
- Do engage with his LinkedIn content when he starts posting
- Quarterly check-in with value (article, insight, introduction) keeps relationship warm without being pushy

# Persona Flexibility Note

Brandon is a strong Aaron persona match - achievement-oriented Enterprise AE navigating high-volume sales with limited tech infrastructure. However, his industry context (industrial maintenance products) creates unique constraints:

- His buyers (maintenance managers) are extremely time-poor and have minimal LinkedIn presence, unlike typical Aaron's buyers who are more digitally native
- His company's lack of sales infrastructure means he can't leverage many tools that typical Aaron persona would benefit from
- His selling motion is more transactional/relationship-based vs. complex enterprise deals

**Approach**: Engage Brandon with Aaron-focused content and tactics, but acknowledge his unique industry constraints. He'll respond to efficiency/productivity content but needs solutions tailored to unglamorous, operationally-focused buyers and minimal tech stack. He's an "Aaron in industrial sales mode" rather than "Aaron in SaaS mode."
