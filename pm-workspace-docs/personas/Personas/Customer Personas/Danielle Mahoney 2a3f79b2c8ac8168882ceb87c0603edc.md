# Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: November 6, 2025 - Initial discovery call with Mike Canova. Discussed company model (rev-share for nonprofit job boards), team structure (post-sale operations oversight), current tech stack challenges, and Planhat implementation struggles (18 months, platform migration).

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 85% match with **Celine (CSM)**

**Secondary Traits**: Shows 30% traits of Odis (Operations) due to broad operational oversight scope

**Classification Rationale**:

Danielle exhibits strong alignment with the Celine (CSM) persona through her post-sale ownership, focus on customer health/outcomes, tool consolidation needs, and scaling challenges. Her role encompasses implementation, CSM, and support teams - all core CSM functions. The revenue accountability tied to CSM performance and data fragmentation pain points are classic CSM challenges. However, she also demonstrates operational leadership characteristics (managing multiple teams, process redesign, platform implementations) that add complexity beyond typical CSM scope.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Consistent Patterns** (1 meeting - baseline):

- Transparent about challenges and constraints
- Seeks practical solutions before committing
- Values seeing proof/demos before decisions
- Cautious about adding tools during active implementations
- Focused on team enablement over personal productivity

**Initial Assessment**:

Danielle is methodical and risk-aware. She explicitly stated need to complete Planhat implementation before evaluating new tools, showing disciplined approach to change management. She's also delegating upward (putting executive summary burden back on CEO), indicating she's comfortable setting boundaries and managing expectations.

# Aggregated Insights

**Pain Points** (by severity):

1. **CRITICAL**: Data fragmentation across multiple systems (Salesforce, Planhat, Notion, Jira, custom internal systems, job board analytics)
2. **HIGH**: Manual executive summary creation for client VPs
3. **HIGH**: Planhat implementation challenges (18 months, platform migration, data accuracy issues)
4. **HIGH**: Scaling team without additional headcount
5. **MEDIUM**: White-glove service expectations across customer tiers
6. **MEDIUM**: Team trust in Planhat data due to historical inaccuracy
7. **MEDIUM**: Self-onboarding complexity for customers

**Goals Consistency**:

- **Primary**: Successfully implement Planhat and establish it as single source of truth
- **Secondary**: Automate executive reporting and data aggregation
- **Tertiary**: Scale operations efficiently without hiring
- **Emerging**: Build internal knowledge base in Notion for team enablement

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**What Works** (proven in this meeting):

- Consultative, non-pushy discovery approach
- Acknowledging timing constraints (Planhat completion first)
- Offering specific use cases relevant to her pain points
- Transparency about product capabilities and limitations
- Scheduling follow-up after she has more clarity on current tools

**What Doesn't** (learned from experience):

- Pushing for immediate demos or decisions
- Ignoring the Planhat implementation timeline
- Positioning as Planhat replacement vs. complement

**Buying Timeline**: Extended - likely Q1 2026 or later. Must complete Planhat implementation and evaluate its full capabilities before considering additional tools. Budget discussions for next year, but new tool adoption on hold.

**Decision-Making Authority**: Influencer/Champion - Has authority over post-sale operations and can drive tool evaluation, but likely needs CEO approval for new platform investments.

# Additional Key Quotes

**On Company Model**:

"> "We do rev share. So we pay our clients every month... We spin up job boards for nonprofits and associations."

**On Planhat Challenges**:

"> "It took, like I'm not even kidding. Like, six or seven months for them to get our data in there correctly to be able to tell tell me if somebody's at risk."

"> "Right now, it [Planhat] is [another fragmented place], which I don't want it to be. Like, that was supposed to be the place where my team went, but now they don't trust it."

**On Buying Timeline**:

"> "I have to get plan hat, like, in before I can do anything. I'll be honest. My they're gonna look at me. Like, I have 85 heads if I'm like, hey. I wanna add this other tool before I fully have."

**On Service Model**:

"> "My team has to be white glove service, especially, like, for, obviously, our top tier clients. But even down to our mid tier because they just don't understand."
