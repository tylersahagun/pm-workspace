# Jared Henriques

AE Contact: James Hinkson
Company: Maple
Email: jared@maplebilling.com
Persona: Odis (https://www.notion.so/Odis-27ff79b2c8ac8056b9ece0a780fbd900?pvs=21)

# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 3, 2025 - Initial product demo call with James Hinkson

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Odis (Operations) with Roger (Revenue) traits

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Presented strongly as Odis based on deep technical knowledge of rev ops stack, systematic discovery approach, and focus on integrations/automation

**Why this classification**:
Jared demonstrates classic Odis characteristics despite his "Head of Sales" title. He approaches the conversation with deep technical fluency around revenue operations—discussing Stripe billing vs. payment processing fees, HubSpot integrations, CPQ flows, subscription automation, and ARR/MRR reporting with the sophistication of someone who lives in the GTM tech stack daily. His discovery approach is methodical and systems-focused, asking about current stack, integration points, and workflow automation rather than leading with typical sales pitches.

However, he shows Roger traits in his role (building GTM motion, scaling sales) and his value-focused approach (emphasizing cost savings, ROI calculations, and business impact). This blend makes him an Odis who happens to be in a revenue leadership role—someone who understands operations deeply and uses that to sell operationally.

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns Across Meetings:**

- **Deep technical fluency**: Discusses Stripe Billing fees (0.7-1.2% per transaction), HubSpot field mapping, line items, API integrations, and subscription logic with ease
- **Discovery-first approach**: Spent first 5+ minutes understanding AskElephant's current stack before pitching
- **Systems thinking**: Frames problems in terms of "stack," "flow," "integration," and "automation"
- **Peer-to-peer positioning**: Approaches conversation as fellow operator rather than salesperson ("pitch for pitch")

**Communication Preferences (learned over time):**

- Prefers screen-sharing live demos over theoretical discussions
- Comfortable with technical depth and complexity
- Uses analogies and relates to shared pain points ("every person I talk to is like, the hell are you talking about?" re: Stripe billing fees)
- Professional but personable (asks about weekend, shares personal life)
- Direct and transparent about product limitations ("I'm still getting myself locked in" re: line items question)

# Strategic Engagement Playbook (Updated)

**Current Stage**: Prospect (discovery completed, next steps scheduled)

**What We've Learned Works:**

- Technical depth resonates—Jared appreciates understanding "how it works" not just "what it does"
- Cost-savings angle landed (Stripe billing fees insight was a "hook" moment)
- Addressing specific pain points (subscription automation gap) created urgency
- Bringing in technical founder (Ashwin) for deeper dive shows appropriate escalation

**What to Avoid (learned from experience):**

- Don't oversimplify—Jared has deep technical knowledge and appreciates precision
- Avoid vague promises—he asked specific questions about line items and needed clarity

**Evolving Priorities:**

1. Meeting 1 Priority: Understanding how Maple solves subscription automation gap that ChartMogul doesn't address
2. Key concern: Budget constraints (already paying for ChartMogul)
3. Decision criteria: Cost comparison, pricing tiers, ability to pull from HubSpot line items

# Key Quotes Across All Meetings

**Meeting 1**: "A lot of this feels like duplicative of Chart Mobile and Stripe, but maybe better. And so I'm wondering, do we, like, do we cancel, for example, the billing piece of Stripe and Chart Mobile if we can do net so this is NRR right now?"

Context: Jared is evaluating Maple as a potential replacement for existing tools, not an addition. This reveals budget-consciousness and stack consolidation thinking—pure Odis behavior.

**Meeting 1**: "Is that does that 1% [Stripe billing fee] come every time they get an invoice, like, forever or just the initial?"

Context: This moment showed Jared catching a hidden cost he wasn't tracking—demonstrated both his operational mindset and the exact pain point Maple addresses. This was a key turning point in the call.

**Meeting 1**: "The specific nuance of getting things to show up as a subscription so that we get ARR tracking the moment something gets signed, that's the hard part. And so that chart mobile doesn't solve well, and I feel like you actually do."

Context: Jared articulated his core problem clearly—automated subscription creation upon quote signature. This is his primary pain point and the reason he's interested in Maple.

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions/Blockers:**

- Reports to: Ashwin (CEO/Founder, former Rippling employee #1)
- Works with: BDR team (mentioned one reached out to AskElephant AE)
- Decision authority: Likely has influence on GTM stack decisions given his role

**Decision Dynamics:**

- Authority level: High—as Head of Sales, he's building the GTM motion and selecting tools
- Key influencers: Ashwin (technical founder) will likely weigh in on integration decisions
- Budget control: Some—but mentioned ChartMogul contract as constraint, suggests he doesn't have unlimited budget

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on aggregate learnings:**

1. **Follow up with detailed pricing breakdown** showing cost comparison vs. Stripe billing fees + ChartMogul for 200 customers growing to 250-300 by year-end
2. **Schedule technical deep dive** on Wednesday Nov 6 at 1pm Eastern with Ben (from AskElephant team) and Ashwin (Maple founder) to address:
    - HubSpot line items integration capability
    - Pricing tiers and scaling costs
    - Implementation timeline and lift
3. **Frame value prop around stack consolidation** not feature addition—emphasize eliminating ChartMogul + Stripe Billing fees
4. **Provide self-serve resources** (documentation, implementation guides) as Jared appreciates DIY approaches

**Watch for:**

- Budget constraints—he's excited but mentioned current commitments to ChartMogul
- Need for technical validation—wants to confirm line items capability before committing
- Timeline pressure—mentioned team going to Hawaii and Thanksgiving creating urgency window
- Integration complexity—as Odis persona, he'll evaluate implementation lift heavily

# Persona Flexibility Note

Jared exhibits Odis as his dominant persona but shows Roger traits when discussing go-to-market strategy and sales motion building. Approach with Odis-focused strategies (technical depth, integration capabilities, automation benefits, stack consolidation) but be ready to pivot to Roger tactics (ROI calculations, cost savings, revenue impact) when discussing business case and pricing. He's a rare blend: an operator who leads sales, which means he'll make operational decisions through a revenue lens.
