Key Quotes: On workflow testing pain: Testing them is a nightmare if you have an external trigger. On self-sufficiency: I will typically try to figure something out 97 times before I ask for help - by the time I'm asking you this question, I'm at my wit's end. On training approach: It's coming directly from the customers, so there's no need for us to even theorize something because I have objective evidence. On data overload: There's 75 messages to 80 messages in a week, and I'm like, product's not gonna read this.
