Tools Mentioned: Redo (partner platform), Shopify
Traits That Don't Match: • Not traditional revenue leader role - appears to be founder/owner
• Less focused on internal team management
• More emphasis on external partnerships vs internal operations
• Service provider rather than traditional B2B SaaS company structure
Traits That Match: • Strategic mindset - discusses go-to-market and network effects
• Partnership-oriented - actively building referral networks
• Growth focus - targets companies "looking to grow"
• Decision-making authority - can make partnership decisions independently
• Multiple business ownership - references "one of my companies"
Validation Notes: Harry is a founder/owner of multiple businesses including "Chew on This" which provides video/marketing services to B2B SaaS companies. His ideal clients are growth-stage B2B SaaS companies targeting D2C Shopify brands. He has existing relationships with key partners like Redo (formerly a client). Matches Roger persona due to strategic thinking, revenue focus, and decision-making authority, but differs as he's a service provider founder rather than internal revenue leader. Strong partnership potential with reciprocal value exchange mindset.
Validation Status: ⚠️ Partial Match (60-79%)
