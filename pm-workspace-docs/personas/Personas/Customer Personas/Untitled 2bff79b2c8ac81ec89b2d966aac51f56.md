- Participants: Jamis Benson (AskElephant), Reagan Nickl (AskNicely)
- Meeting Type: Voicemail
- Note: This was an outbound voicemail from Jamis to Reagan at AskNicely. The call focused on reconnecting after a previous conversation with Mike from a couple months ago. Jamis mentioned that Reagan had indicated there might be more of a use case towards the end of the year, and he's attempting to revisit those conversations in preparation for New Year budget evaluations. No specific business outcomes from using AskElephant were discussed as this was a prospecting/follow-up voicemail.
