Tools Mentioned: Apollo, ChatGPT, RingCentral
Traits That Don't Match: • Currently SDR, not AE (though trajectory is toward AE)
• Doesn't close deals yet (hands off to owner)
• Very niche market (5-6K breweries/distilleries in USA)
• Solo SDR without team (Aaron typically has team context)
• Working across extreme timezone differences (South Africa to US)
• Only 3 months in remote/tech-based sales (vs years for typical Aaron)

• Values relationships and context over transactional selling
• Tech-forward mindset, proactively building tech stack
• Seeks efficiency through automation
• Actively learning and improving skills
• Uses LinkedIn strategically for outreach
• Comfortable with consultative selling approach

Validation Notes: Odette shows strong Aaron (AE) characteristics but is currently in an SDR role. She has 16 years of sales experience (face-to-face outbound), recently transitioned to remote SDR work (3 months ago), and is building the tech stack from scratch at Bridgetown Brew. Works night shift (2AM MST) from South Africa to serve US customers. Solo SDR who hands off to owner for closing. Highly motivated to learn, actively seeking demos and coaching. Values relationship-building over pitch-slapping. Strong alignment with AI-enhancement philosophy.
Validation Status: ⚠️ Partial Match (60-79%)

# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 5, 2025 - LinkedIn coaching session with Jamis. Odette sought guidance on LinkedIn outreach strategy, avoiding pitch-slapping while building relationships. Discussed daily LinkedIn activities, DM strategies, content posting frameworks, and scheduled AskElephant demo.

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 75% match with Aaron (AE)
**Secondary Traits**: Shows 40% traits of early-stage SDR persona (if existed)

**Classification Rationale**:
Odette is classified as Aaron (AE) with partial match because she demonstrates core AE characteristics: extensive sales experience (16 years), relationship-focused selling, strategic tool adoption, and consultative approach. However, she's currently functioning as an SDR in her first remote/tech sales role (3 months), doesn't close deals, and works in a highly specialized niche market. She's on a clear trajectory toward AE responsibilities and already thinks/operates like an experienced AE despite her current title.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Consistent Patterns** (1 meeting - baseline):

- Relationship-first mindset: Repeatedly emphasized not wanting to "pitch slap" and building connections before selling
- Learning orientation: Actively seeks coaching, demos, and knowledge from experienced professionals
- Tech-adoption advocate: Proactively pushed for Apollo and HubSpot when company had no CRM
- Authenticity in communication: Casual, honest, self-aware about limitations

**Evolution Observed**:

- Initially: Face-to-face field sales for 16 years (driving to customers)
- Currently: 3 months into remote SDR role, building digital outreach skills
- Trajectory: Moving toward closing deals (wants to eventually take on AE responsibilities, mentioned 6-8 month timeline)

# Aggregated Insights

**Pain Points (Frequency)**:

- Manual processes/lack of automation (mentioned 3 times)
- Time constraints due to solo role + timezone challenges (mentioned 2 times)
- Starting from scratch with no CRM or systems (mentioned 2 times)
- Uncertainty about LinkedIn best practices (mentioned throughout)
- Niche market limiting reach (mentioned 2 times)

**Goals Consistency**:

- Primary: Build LinkedIn presence and effective outreach strategy
- Secondary: Streamline sales operations with right tech stack
- Emerging: Grow into closing role and potentially build team

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**What Works** (proven in this meeting):

- Peer-to-peer coaching approach (Jamis sharing his personal LinkedIn process)
- Concrete frameworks with specific numbers (10-15 comments, 5 DMs, 3 voice messages daily)
- Drawing parallels to her strength (cold calling) to teach new skill (LinkedIn DMs)
- Recognizing her experience and treating her as capable professional
- Offering ongoing support and connection to other team members (Ada)

**What Doesn't** (learned from experience):

- Avoid treating her as inexperienced despite new role (she has 16 years sales background)
- Don't assume she needs basic sales training (she needs tech/platform training)
- Avoid scheduling meetings that conflict with her extreme timezone constraints

# Key Quotes Collection

**On Experience & Background:**
"I've been doing sales for a very long time, like sixteen years... I've always been outbound, you know, so actually face to face."

**On Tech Stack Building:**
"When I started, I had to use ChatGPT and a Google Sheet. And I was like, guys, I can't do this... So I was like, okay. Please, can we can we just start with these two things? It already makes my life easier, you know, with having Apollo to pull info from... and having my CRM."

**On AI Philosophy:**
"I'm a firm believer in, like, tech AI. It's there to make our lives easier, you know, to enhance it, to make it quicker, to make things flow. And these guys that are like, oh, AI is gonna take your job and this. And I'm like, no, guys. AI isn't gonna take my job because it's not a human, but a human that understands this stuff is gonna take my job if I don't keep up with it."

**On Sales Approach:**
"For me, it's always about building relationships, getting to know before you just jump right in... I don't want to have someone write a LinkedIn post about me just pitch slapping them there from the get go."

**On Learning Orientation:**
"Every every little bit of knowledge I can take in, I try and take in, and I try and learn. Like, I did a demo for Clay earlier on... if I find something that offers like a demo, I sign myself up and I go watch that demo because I find it so interesting."

**On Cold Calling Comfort:**
"I'll cold call. You know, I I like that. Like hearing the word no. That's my favorite word, you know, not now and stuff like that."

**On Current Process Pain:**

"Every time I wanna make a call, I've gotta go into HubSpot, I'm gonna go look for that person, I've gotta go click on that contact, then I've gotta go highlight the phone number, then I've gotta go back to my dialer, then I've gotta copy and paste it there, and then I can phone. So it doesn't sound like a lot, but if I have to do it 20 times over, it becomes such a tedious process."
