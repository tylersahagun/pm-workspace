Validation Notes: Suji demonstrates strong Aaron (AE) persona characteristics with 85% confidence. She's in a full-cycle sales role at a high-growth startup (Trellus.AI - 4-person team managing 450-500 customers). Her pain points center around manual CRM work and time management, which aligns with Aaron's efficiency focus. She shows strong technical understanding of sales tools and integrations, values automation, and takes a consultative partnership approach.

Key differentiators from typical Aaron persona: operates at smaller company scale, more hands-on with technical details, and wears multiple hats (BDR/SDR/AE/CS). Her communication style is casual and collaborative rather than formal corporate. Despite these differences, core motivations align: seeking tools that save time, improve efficiency, and enable better customer relationships.

Strategic engagement note: Suji responds well to technical demonstrations, values mutual benefit in partnerships, and needs solutions that work for resource-constrained teams. She has founder access for decision-making but describes herself as taking lead on partnership evaluation.
Validation Status: Strong Match
