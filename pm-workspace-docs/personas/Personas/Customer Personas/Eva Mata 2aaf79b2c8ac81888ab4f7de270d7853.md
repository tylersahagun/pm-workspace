Tools Mentioned: Microsoft Teams, Salesforce
Traits That Don't Match: More hands-on with tactical evaluation than typical strategic executive • Directly involved in tool setup and workflows rather than purely strategic oversight
Traits That Match: Strong decision-making authority as sales ops leader • Focused on scaling operations and team efficiency • Strategic thinker evaluating ROI and impact • Delegates to team but stays involved in key decisions • Data quality and CRM hygiene are top priorities • Values coaching and enablement • Budget-conscious, negotiates pricing • Tasked with AI tool adoption by leadership • Q1 goals for approval and rollout
Validation Notes: Eva demonstrates strong Odis (Operations) persona traits with 85% confidence. She's a Sales Operations leader at Broadvoice tasked with AI tool adoption. Key priorities: CRM data quality (especially close won/loss analysis and discovery field capture), automating Salesforce updates, and sales team efficiency. Decision maker who negotiates pricing, evaluates multiple vendors, and needs to pitch internally to get buy-in for 12+ US reps with potential global scale. Target timeline: Q1 approval with possible Q4 close. Very hands-on in evaluation despite strategic role - will own tool setup with Jen. Location: LA (San Fernando Valley).
Validation Status: ✅ Strong Match (80-100%)

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 45% match with Roger (Revenue Leader)

**Classification Rationale**:
Based on being identified as "the decision maker" and a manager, Eva likely fits a leadership/executive persona. The 45% confidence reflects limited data from a single brief interaction where she was not present.
