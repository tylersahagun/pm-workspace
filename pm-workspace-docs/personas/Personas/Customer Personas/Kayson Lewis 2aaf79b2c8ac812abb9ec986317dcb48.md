# Meeting History

- November 13, 2025 (13:14-13:16 MST): Adia/Kayson Interview - Brief interview setup call where Tony Mickelsen coordinated technical logistics before leaving Adia and Kayson to conduct the interview.

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 0% - Insufficient data for persona classification

**Classification Rationale**:
This was an interview call with extremely limited interaction captured in the transcript (1:27 minutes). The recorded portion only contains technical setup coordination with Tony Mickelsen transitioning off the call. No substantive business discussion, role indicators, pain points, or goals were discussed in the captured portion.

Context suggests this is a job interview scenario rather than a client/prospect engagement, which may place this contact outside the typical persona framework designed for customer-facing relationships.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Observed Patterns**:

- Polite and professional during brief interaction
- Cooperative with technical adjustments
- Expressed appreciation ("Appreciate it", "Thanks, Tony")

**Evolution Observed**:

- First recorded meeting - no historical data for comparison

**Goals**: None discussed in captured portion

**Communication Approach**: Limited data, but showed:
