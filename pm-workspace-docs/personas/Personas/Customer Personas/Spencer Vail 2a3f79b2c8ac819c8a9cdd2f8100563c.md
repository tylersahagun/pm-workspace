Key Quotes: "I kinda look at it from always, like, two levels. One is, like, what's the value to the rep? And then, like, what's the value to me as, like, a leader and a manager?"

"I don't wanna just spend money for a tool that kind of falls by the wayside and people just go back to doing what they've always done."

"Does it empower, enable me to to coach, to train, to to find trends, and to be just more impactful and, like, use my time in a higher leverage way than I do today."

"That's the kind of stuff that, like, I would love as a manager instead of, you know, waiting for a rep to flag that to me."
