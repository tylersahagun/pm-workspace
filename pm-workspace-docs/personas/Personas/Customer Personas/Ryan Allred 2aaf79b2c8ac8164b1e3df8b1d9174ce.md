Validation Notes: Ryan has minimal participation in this meeting, making persona classification difficult. He introduces himself and mentions personal connection with Woody (AskElephant team member) but doesn't demonstrate clear sales, technical, or strategic behaviors. His role appears to be relationship/network-based, possibly early-stage BD or relationship management. More meeting data needed for confident persona match. Currently does not strongly align with any defined persona.
Validation Status: Weak Match

# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 13, 2025 - Present but minimal participation on Aldea pitch call

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 35% - No strong match with any persona
**Secondary Traits**: Shows 20% traits of Aaron (relationship building), 15% Celine (casual style)

**Classification Rationale**:
Ryan's limited participation in this meeting makes confident persona classification impossible. He appears to be on the call primarily due to his personal connection with Woody from AskElephant rather than a defined role in the sales process. His contributions focused on relationship context rather than sales, technical, or strategic elements. May be early in role, doing relationship-based BD, or simply supporting the team through his network. Requires additional meeting observations to properly classify.
