Key Quotes: 1. On pain points with current tools: "We've been using Gong for two years, but there hasn't been much updates to it. It's still very manual having to drill down to a specific customer call or search for an exact search term. So I can go in and I can say, when did a customer mention this exact feature? But I can't do more general terms of, like, what objections have been brought up. And then all of that just lives in Gong. There's no updates to Salesforce because of it."

2. On manual CRM updates: "A couple of things that we like to track is, like, what CRM are you using? Salesforce, HubSpot, and then our reps need to update that in Salesforce. And because it's been entirely manual, it doesn't get updated a lot of the time."

3. On role description: "I'm over RevOps and implementation here on the mobile side... organizing the mess. That's a lot of what it is, organizing the mess."

4. On priorities: "Sales to CS handoff. That's a big one for us, making sure that that is a smooth process."

5. On data preservation concerns: "We're a little worried about being able to maintain that history that we've had with Gong calls. I'm curious what we can do to keep some of that or if there's a way to import to AskElephant or what we can do to not lose the two year history we've had with some call recordings." [Context: 3,600 historical calls]

6. On customer quote workflow: "We actually just created the other day a Slack channel called Raving Fans. That is whenever someone mentions something they love about Mobley that we want to be able to pull that in."

7. On tagging needs: "Essentially, the question is how can we best indicate in AskElephant who is a customer and who isn't? And so whatever if it's a tag, if it's anything else, but being able to because I know our we have our product team in AskElephant as well. So for them to be able to see, like, what our customer's asking for and being able to filter just to that subset easily."
