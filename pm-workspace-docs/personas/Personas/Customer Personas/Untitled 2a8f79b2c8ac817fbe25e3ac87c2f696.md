# Meeting History

**Meeting 1: November 11, 2025** - Product demo with Woody Klemetson

- Context: Demonstrated LinkCarl referral platform functionality
- Topics: B2B referrals, data enrichment challenges, HubSpot integration setup
- Outcome: Agreed to email setup instructions and explore data sourcing alternatives

# Persona Validation Summary

**Primary Match**: 85% Roger (Revenue Leader)
**Secondary Traits**: 40% Odis (Operations) - technical depth and process optimization

**Classification Rationale**:
Jonah is a founder/CEO leading revenue strategy and product direction, fitting Roger's profile. However, he shows exceptional technical depth - discussing data scraping methods, APIs, and Chrome extensions with expertise typically seen in technical roles. This creates a hybrid profile: strategic revenue leader with hands-on technical capabilities.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Baseline Established (Meeting 1)**:

- Transparent about product journey and failures
- Solution-oriented technical problem-solver
- Values ethical business practices
- Actively seeks cost-optimization strategies
- Collaborative knowledge sharer

**Expected Evolution**:
Moving from technical problem-solving phase into customer validation and scale phase. Will likely maintain technical involvement while increasing focus on revenue metrics.

# Aggregated Insights

## Pain Points (Priority Order):

1. **Data enrichment costs** - Major concern, discussed extensively (5+ mentions)
2. **LinkedIn scraping reliability** - Technical challenge limiting product capability (3 mentions)
3. **Integration complexity** - HubSpot private apps vs one-click setup
4. **Product-market fit validation** - Third iteration seeking validation

## Goals Consistency:

- **Primary**: Validate B2B referral product with real customers

## On Ethics & Integrity:

## On Technical Problem-Solving:

> "The problem is when you scrape LinkedIn, they're super protective. LinkedIn is. And so it's not that reliable actually to solely do scraping. And so buying the history is gets it to where it's much more accurate."

## On Customer Value:
