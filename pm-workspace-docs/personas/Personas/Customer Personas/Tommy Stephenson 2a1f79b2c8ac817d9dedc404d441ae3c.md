# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 3, 2025 - Initial discovery/interview call for Head of Product role

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Odis (Operations) with strong Roger (Revenue Leader) traits

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Presented as Odis/Roger hybrid with 25+ years of deep technical product and operations expertise combined with strategic revenue leadership experience

**Why this classification**:
Tommy exhibits a unique blend of Odis and Roger characteristics. Primary Odis indicators include his deep technical expertise (built ecommerce platforms from scratch, CTO experience at WeedMaps and Deloitte), systems thinking ("translate the technology and requirements into usability"), focus on engineering team management and product operations, and comfort with the technical details of integrations and architecture. However, he also shows strong Roger traits through his revenue leadership experience (ran a successful agency generating $7M+ in revenue, sold to partners, raised capital for multiple products), strategic business thinking (sold his first ecommerce platform, multiple product exits), and ability to work at the intersection of technology and business outcomes. His superpower is bridging technical architecture with user experience and business value.

# Strategic Engagement Playbook (Updated)

**Current Stage**: Candidate/Prospect for Head of Product Role

**What We've Learned Works:**

- Woody's direct leadership style resonates strongly with Tommy
- Discussing product as GM role (not just "product manager") aligns with Tommy's philosophy
- Acknowledging his technical depth while understanding his revenue leadership background
- Framing role as high accountability, high ownership ("the buck stops with you")
- Utah location is advantageous (parents nearby, familiar with area, cost-effective travel)

**What to Avoid:**

- Don't frame this as just a technical role, he's strategic and revenue-minded
- Avoid emphasizing administrative tasks or SOW follow-ups (he admits this isn't his strength)
- Don't compare to typical "consultant" stereotypes, he's a builder, not just an advisor
- Don't question his commitment level, he's proven workaholic comfortable with startup intensity

**Current Priorities:**

1. Finding a role where he can be product GM with full accountability
2. Working with strong sales leadership (drawn to leaders like Woody and WeedMaps CEO)
3. Avoiding large enterprise bureaucracy (can't go to Google, wants startup environment)
4. Continuing to learn and stay relevant with AI and emerging tech
5. Having operational support for administrative tasks he doesn't enjoy

6. Consider his network of "three product guys" as potential referral pipeline

**Watch for:**

- His reaction to AskElephant's product architecture and technical decisions
- Cultural fit during working sessions with team
- Whether he's genuinely ready to commit to full-time role vs. continuing consulting
- His comfort level with current company stage (couple hundred customers, millions in revenue)
- Any concerns about company size vs. his experience at larger organizations

**Key Value Props to Emphasize:**

- HubSpot ecosystem fit (he's a "huge HubSpot fan" and current partner)

- Strong sales leadership in Woody (similar to leaders he's thrived under)
- Technical challenges with AI, integrations, and workflow automation
- Autonomy and accountability as product GM
- Utah location advantages (family nearby, tech ecosystem, travel flexibility)

**Red Flags to Monitor:**

- Deloitte consulting background, need to validate he's builder not advisor
- Multiple ventures/side projects, ensure he's ready for full-time commitment
- Administrative weakness, need strong operations support structure
- Product-first (vs. customer-first) mindset, ensure alignment with AskElephant philosophy

# Persona Flexibility Note

Tommy exhibits Odis (Operations) as his foundational persona based on 25+ years of technical product development, systems integration expertise, and engineering team management. However, he demonstrates strong Roger (Revenue Leader) characteristics through his agency ownership, revenue generation success, capital raising experience, and strategic business acumen. Approach with Odis-level technical depth and systems thinking, but engage him at Roger-level strategic discussions around business outcomes, GTM strategy, and revenue impact. He thinks like an operator but speaks the language of revenue leadership. For product discussions, lead with technical architecture and user experience. For business case and role discussions, emphasize revenue impact, market positioning, and strategic vision.

**Interview Context**: This was a screening call for AskElephant's Head of Product role. Woody reached out via LinkedIn. Tommy has researched AskElephant, watched product videos, and is genuinely interested. He's currently contracting at Deloitte but seeking full-time product leadership opportunity. He has eye procedure Tuesday/Wednesday but available Thursday/Friday for follow-up demo and working sessions. Next step: Product demo with small working session to assess collaboration style.

## Meeting 2: November 10, 2025 - Product Feedback & Working Session

**Context**: Tommy spent his weekend deeply testing AskElephant platform and created a functional prototype with comprehensive UX improvements using Base44/Lovable AI tools. This was a product walkthrough where Tommy presented his redesign concepts.

**Key Behaviors Observed**:

• Builder mentality in action: Didn't just provide feedback, built a working prototype over 48 hours

• Visual communication style: Prefers showing clickable prototypes vs. written feedback or decks

• Systems thinking: Designed hierarchical "workspaces → projects → meetings" organization system

• User experience focus: Identified navigation cohesion issues, lack of sortability, onboarding gaps

• Workflow automation passion: Created innovative concept for AI processing order based on workspace context

• Power user orientation: Wants platform to be daily-use "management console" with rapid access

**Product Insights Delivered**:

• Onboarding: Designed comprehensive getting started flow with checklist, platform tour, feature highlights

• Navigation: Proposed unified navigation with persistent help/tour access, collapsible views

• Organization: Created "workspaces" concept to group projects across companies/teams

• Workflows: Envisioned business-user-friendly automation ("n8n for business users")

• Meeting Management: Designed enhanced meeting cards, filtering (by platform/date/company), sortability

• Contact/Company Views: Added project associations, file storage, meeting history by entity

**Unique Innovation**:

Tommy's most compelling concept: Visual workflow builder where users can drag/drop meetings into processing order, group related conversations, and have AI generate outcomes based on the sequential context. "Nobody has this that I've seen in a lot of what I do on a day to day."

**Validation of Persona**:

This meeting strongly confirms Odis (Operations) classification with exceptional product design capabilities. Tommy exhibits:

- Technical depth (references Jira epics/stories, API integrations)
- User experience expertise (learning theory, visual hierarchy)
- Workflow automation mastery (processing order, AI orchestration)

The combination of technical operations knowledge + hands-on design execution + strategic product thinking = 85% Odis match with strong product leadership traits.

**Communication & Decision Style**:

• Direct and honest: "If I didn't like it, I'd just be like, it's not for me"

• Action-oriented: Builds solutions rather than just describing problems

• Collaborative: "Me and you can riff together"
