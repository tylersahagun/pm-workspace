Tools Mentioned: LinkedIn
Traits That Don't Match: • SDR role rather than full Account Executive
• More focused on top-of-funnel activities (prospecting) vs. closing deals
• Less experienced than typical Aaron persona
• Not managing full sales cycle
Traits That Match: • Front-line seller focused on outbound prospecting
• Wants coaching and feedback to improve performance
• Looking for efficiency in daily workflows
• Manager overwhelmed with too many reps (7 reps, 700 calls/week)
• Actively seeking ways to improve conversion rates
• Growth-oriented mindset
Validation Notes: Max is an SDR at LevelAccess working on a 7-person team handling ~100 calls/day. Primary pain point is lack of individual coaching due to manager bandwidth (Elvira manages 7 reps with 700 calls/week). Shows strong alignment with Aaron persona characteristics - wants feedback, seeks efficiency, focused on pipeline generation. Main gap is SDR vs. AE role, but pain points and goals align well with AskElephant's coaching value prop. Successfully using personalized LinkedIn outreach (foster animals approach). Reports to Elvira Josifi (elvira.josifi@levelaccess.com) who would be the economic buyer.
Validation Status: Partial Match (60-79%)

# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 14, 2025 - Discovery call discussing AskElephant's coaching tool for SDR team at LevelAccess

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 75% match with Aaron (AE)

**Secondary Traits**: Shows some characteristics of end-user/champion rather than economic buyer

**Classification Rationale**: Max exhibits strong alignment with the Aaron persona as a front-line seller who desperately needs coaching and feedback. His manager Elvira oversees 7 reps handling 700 calls/week, making individual coaching impossible. This creates a perfect use case for AskElephant's AI coaching capabilities. The primary gap is that Max is an SDR rather than a full-cycle AE, focusing more on prospecting than closing. However, his pain points (lack of coaching, need for efficiency) and goals (hit quota, reduce manual work) align perfectly with our ICP. Max can serve as a champion/end user, while Elvira would be the economic decision maker.
