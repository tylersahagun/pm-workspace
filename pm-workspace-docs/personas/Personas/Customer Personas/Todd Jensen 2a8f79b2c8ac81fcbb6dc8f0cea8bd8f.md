Traits That Don't Match: • Not a traditional AE (Aaron persona) - he's in Marketing
• Doesn't own revenue quota
• More strategic/analytical than relationship-driven
• Less focused on individual deals, more on aggregate insights
Traits That Match: • Power user of AI tools (weekly sessions with CSM)
• Marketing-focused on customer insights
• Data-driven approach to messaging
• Seeks competitive intelligence
• Values efficiency and automation
• Analytically minded
Validation Notes: Moderate match with Aaron (AE) persona at 75% confidence. The match is imperfect because Todd is Marketing, not Sales, but his usage patterns align with power users in AE roles.

Better classification might be a Marketing Operations or Revenue Operations persona (not in current framework).

Key alignment points: Power user behavior (weekly workflow creation), data-driven approach, seeks automation and efficiency, champion for the product internally.

Key gaps: No quota or deal responsibility. More analytical than relationship-focused. Aggregate insights over individual customer focus.

Strategic implications: Treat as champion and internal advocate. He's sophisticated enough to build complex workflows and will push for advanced features. Good source of product feedback and use case development.
Validation Status: High Confidence Match
