Validation Notes: Maria Alejandra is part of the On The Fuze team that recently received AskElephant training and was described as "really happy" with it. As a newly-titled "HubSpot Consultant" (formerly project manager), she represents the end-user implementation team who will use the AI agent to identify referral opportunities. Match confidence is moderate (65%) as she's an internal partner team member rather than direct client implementation specialist.
Validation Status: ⚠️ Partial Match (60-79%)

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 65% match with Irina (Implementation)
**Context**: Partner team member in learning/implementation phase

**Classification Rationale**:
Maria Alejandra fits the Implementation persona as an end-user learning new tools and processes. However, she's positioned differently than typical Irina personas - she's on the partner side, not client-facing implementation. Her role as a HubSpot Consultant who will execute referral identification using AI agents places her in an implementation/execution capacity.
