Validation Notes: Moderate Aaron (AE) match at 75% confidence. Jake appears to be in sales/BDR role at Lead Mamut, working alongside founder Bruno. Originally championed AskElephant evaluation. Shows strong process orientation (maintains CRM well per Bruno). Technical interest in automation and cost optimization. Less assertive communication style on calls - defers to Bruno for decision-making but clearly influential in tool selection. Limited evidence in single meeting to fully validate AE persona - needs additional meeting data to confirm quota focus, pipeline management, and typical AE behavioral patterns.
Validation Status: ⚠️ Moderate Match (60-79%)
