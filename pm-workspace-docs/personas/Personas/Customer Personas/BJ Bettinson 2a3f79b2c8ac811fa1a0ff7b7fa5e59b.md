# BJ Bettinson

Detected Role: Operations/RevOps
Email: bj.bettinson@gmail.com
Key Quotes: "Out of those three, CRM hygiene would definitely be the biggest priority that I mean, we have issues with that every single day and every single rep."

"Sometimes they'll be calling a firm for, you know, two months before they realize they've actually been hitting up a customer and bothering them because there was no way to know previously that, you know, they had a duplicate account."

"Not only do our reps put stuff in different spots, but all the account executives put all their notes in different spots. So as far as visibility goes, there isn't a lot in the current system."

**Classification Rationale**:
BJ exhibits strong operational thinking characteristic of the Odis persona, with deep concern for CRM hygiene, data quality, team visibility, and cross-functional process efficiency.
