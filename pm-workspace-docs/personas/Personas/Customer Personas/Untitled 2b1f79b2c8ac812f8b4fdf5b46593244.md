Summary: This meeting focused on job search strategies for salespeople, tool recommendations (Apollo, Condo, Loom), and potential partnership opportunities for AskElephant referrals. Steven Farmer is a tech sales recruiter, not an AskElephant customer. The conversation did not include specific business outcomes from using AskElephant. Steven expressed interest in referring companies that fit AskElephant's ICP (HubSpot/Salesforce users, 50-500 employees, with outbound sales motions).
