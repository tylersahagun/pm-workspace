Validation Notes: **First Interaction - Training Call Context**

Daniel is an SDR in his first few weeks at Mountain (B2C marketing platform). Mike positioned this as a training call about LinkedIn outreach strategies in exchange for an intro to Daniel's manager.

**Role & Responsibility**:
- Hybrid SDR: 50% inbound leads, 50% outbound prospecting
- 25 meetings/month quota, ~50 calls/day activity
- Reports to Gabby D'Angelo (SDR Manager, ~10 reps)
- Part of 12-person training cohort

**Pain Points Validated**:
✅ Manual CRM note-taking after every call
✅ AEs requesting more/better context on leads
✅ Cold calling challenges and low connect rates
✅ Building personal brand on LinkedIn while complying with company guidelines

**Tools & Stack**:
- CRM: Salesforce
- Conversation Intelligence: Gong (but limited coaching - manager can't review all calls)
- Sales Engagement: Outreach (sequences, email)
- Dialer: Nooks (team rooms feature)
- Data: Cognism
- Collaboration: Slack, Google Workspace

**AskElephant Fit**:
- Would personally benefit from auto-logging calls, eliminating note-taking
- Recognized coaching gap (Gabby managing 10 reps, 250+ conversations/week)
- But NOT the buyer - needs to route to Gabby D'Angelo or Severin (RevOps leader)

**Champion Potential**: HIGH
- Agreed to make warm intro to manager
- Willing to post about the call on LinkedIn
- Genuine, helpful personality
- Values the training Mike provided

**Next Steps**:
- Daniel to intro Mike to Gabby D'Angelo (SDR Manager - actual buyer)
- Alternative path: Severin (Go-to-Market Architect/RevOps - loves tech)
- Daniel will post on LinkedIn about the call (tag Mike)
