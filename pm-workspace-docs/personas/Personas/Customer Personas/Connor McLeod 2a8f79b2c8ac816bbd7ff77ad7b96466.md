Validation Notes: First meeting analysis - November 11, 2025. Connor owns go-to-market for a custom software development consulting firm. Strong match with Roger (Revenue Leader) persona at 85% confidence. Key Context: Manages 2+ sales reps selling $200K-$1M software projects, low call volume (3-4/week) but high-value deals. Currently using Salesforce (free license) but poor adoption. Partner Greg drives most leads. Connor handles lead gen personally. Has decision authority, needs team buy-in. Evaluating both as direct customer AND potential partner. Product background with dual use case: internal sales tracking + portfolio company validation.
