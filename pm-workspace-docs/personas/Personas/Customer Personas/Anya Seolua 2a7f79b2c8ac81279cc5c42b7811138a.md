# Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: November 10, 2025 - Initial cold outreach call, 2-minute discovery conversation

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 75% match with Roger (Revenue Leader)

**Secondary Traits**: Shows some traits requiring additional validation through follow-up conversations

**Classification Rationale**:
Anya holds a CRO position at QSoft, which directly aligns with the Roger persona (Revenue Leader). She demonstrated immediate recognition of the pain points mentioned (handoff between sales and CS, CRM hygiene), which are core concerns for revenue leaders. Her decision-making authority is clear from her title, and she agreed to a follow-up meeting, indicating these challenges resonate with her current needs.

The 75% confidence reflects that this was a brief initial call where she was somewhat guarded, so full behavioral patterns haven't yet emerged. The Friday follow-up will provide more data to increase confidence.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Initial Patterns** (Meeting 1):

- Screening behavior: Asked "Who is this?" suggesting she receives many calls
- Professional but cautious communication style
- Quick to agree to scheduled follow-up rather than impromptu discussion
- Values proper context (requested LinkedIn connection first)

**Evolution Observed**:

- Initially: Guarded, brief responses
- During call: Warmed slightly, agreed to continue conversation
- Trajectory: Moving toward engagement with proper scheduling and context

# Aggregated Insights

**Pain Points (Frequency)**:

- Handoff between sales and CS (implied interest - mentioned 1 time)
- CRM hygiene for sales reps (implied interest - mentioned 1 time)

**Goals Consistency**:

- Primary: Improve team efficiency (implied from pain point acknowledgment)
- Secondary: Better data quality (implied from CRM hygiene interest)
- Emerging: Needs more conversation to identify specific goals

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**What Works** (emerging hypotheses):

- Respecting her time by offering scheduled calls vs. pushing for immediate conversation
- Leading with peer insights ("other revenue leaders like yourself")
- Connecting on LinkedIn before deeper business discussion
- Being in Missouri timezone for scheduling

**What Doesn't** (learned from experience):

- Cold calling without context may get screened
- Pushing for immediate in-depth conversation on first touch
