# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: 2025-11-06 - Initial AskElephant demo and discovery call focused on sales coaching, customer insights, and Australian market research strategy

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 85% match with Roger (Revenue Leader)
**Secondary Traits**: Shows 30% traits of Odis (Operations) due to hands-on involvement in process setup

**Classification Rationale**:
Maria clearly fits the Roger persona as she holds ultimate revenue responsibility, makes strategic decisions about tools and methodology, and focuses on team effectiveness. Her emphasis on "selling more effectively" over pure efficiency, combined with her specific revenue targets and concern for coaching quality, align strongly with revenue leader priorities. The 15% gap comes from her more hands-on involvement (typical for smaller organizations) and acute budget constraints.

# Key Quotes Collection

**On Revenue Pressure:**
"So we currently are doing about a 120 of revenue a month. We want to get to, by February, doing 200 k and do two being doing $2.60 k by April."

**On Core Challenge:**
"our biggest, like, immediate burning platform problem is we've got a small sales team that needs to cover a lot more ground and make a lot more sales"

**On Priorities:**
"It's definitely both. But I do think selling more effectively would probably have the bigger impact. Because no matter how much ground you can cover, if you're not doing it effectively, it doesn't yield the results."

**On Market Research:**
"I've had about 90 so far. But from all these different conversations, like, what is what are we learning about what's going on in that market and and where what are people telling us, like, our value ad would be in our kind of USP in that market?"

**On Use Case Recognition:**
"Because one of the challenges we have is for our larger deals, we might have a salesperson talking to the customer. But then at some point, they'll have qualified the deal, and they need the technical lead to scope what we can actually deliver to that customer."
