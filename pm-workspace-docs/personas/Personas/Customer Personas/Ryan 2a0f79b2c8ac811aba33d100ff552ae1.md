# Meeting 1 - November 3, 2025

Initial LinkedIn consultation call (23 minutes)

## Persona: Roger (Eager Learner)

Ryan is textbook Roger - follows AskElephant team content daily, humble about gaps, highly coachable, takes direction from manager Landon. Also shows Celine traits in relationship building.

## Background

- Age 45, 25 years mortgage  tech sales
- SDR promoted to Account Executive
- Only SDR in entire company
- Reports to Landon Bugard (CRO)

## Primary Pain Point

ZERO meetings booked from LinkedIn despite posting

## Key Insights

- Feed "full of AskElephant" - perfect example of brand saturation
- Posts inconsistently, come across as ads
- Uses ChatGPT incorrectly (for ideas vs drafting)
- Uses HubSpot, no call recording software
- Company provides outsourced/co-managed IT services

## Relationship Intelligence

KEY DECISION MAKER: Landon Bugard (CRO)

- Already follows AskElephant (told Ryan to follow Adia)
- Manages Marketing, SDR, AE teams
- Mike sent LinkedIn connection during call
- Ryan approaching for 30-min training in exchange for meeting

Team Structure:

- Utah: Landon, Ryan, Moriah
- Other locations: 6 team members
- Customer management separate from Landon

## Strategy

What Works: Direct coaching, value trades, authentic approach
Current Priorities: LinkedIn engagement  book meetings  prove AE capabilities

## Next Steps

1. Ryan asking Landon about training meeting trade
2. Follow up tomorrow if no response
3. Landon connection request sent with Ryan referral

## Key Quotes

"I have not gotten a single meeting off of LinkedIn"
"My feed is full of AskElephant"
"Landon is like a genius when it comes to this stuff"

## Opportunity Assessment

Size: Medium-High

- Entire revenue team could benefit
- HubSpot integration ready
- No call recording (gap to fill)
- Efficiency need (only 1 SDR)
- Pipeline pressure before Thanksgiving

# Meeting 2 - November 7, 2025

Quick follow-up call (5 minutes) - Ryan was finishing golf with client and Moriah

## Context

- Just finished client golf outing with Moriah
- Landon had to leave early for another call
- Coordinating demo scheduling and golf outing for next week

## Key Developments

- Confirmed Landon is "100% a go" for demo
- Ryan and Moriah both want LinkedIn training (100% committed)
- Other sales team members also interested
- Golf outing planned for next week with Mike (AE demo)
- Utah team: Ryan, Moriah (both AEs), Landon

## Relationship Building Insight

**Major Discovery**: Ryan expressed he's "always courting everybody else" but nobody courts him. Very positive response to being valued through golf invitation - builds reciprocity and strengthens relationship.

## Communication Pattern

- Quick, casual check-ins
- Apologetic about timing (shows respect)
- Coordinates well with team
- Direct confirmation on Landon's interest

## Strategic Notes

Golf = Primary relationship building tool for Ryan. Using same approach (golf + demo) leverages his own methodology and shows we understand his world.
