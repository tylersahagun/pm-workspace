Traits That Don't Match: N/A - no persona assigned yet
Traits That Match: Unable to determine - insufficient business content in conversation
Validation Notes: Initial meeting analysis 11/14/2025 - Very limited business content. Meeting consisted primarily of technical troubleshooting (video routing to phone) and friendly social banter. No clear role indicators, pain points, or business goals discussed. Requires follow-up meetings with substantive business discussion to determine persona match. Mike mentioned someone was no-showing, suggesting this may have been an impromptu or informal call rather than a scheduled business meeting.
