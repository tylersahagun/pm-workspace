Tools Mentioned: Excel/Sheets, Gong, HubSpot
Traits That Don't Match: • Not in Operations/RevOps role directly - is a BDR leader
• More tactical SDR management vs. strategic operations role
• Less focus on system architecture and more on day-to-day rep productivity
• Aspiring to move up to AE role (enterprise AE goal of $300k/year mentioned)
• Still individual contributor mindset with team leadership responsibilities
Traits That Match: • BDR leader managing multiple SDRs (supports 3 AEs: Christian, Sager, Jeff)
• Frustrated with CRM hygiene and data quality issues
• Deals with duplicate accounts and wasted prospecting time
• Tracking quota attainment ($200k quota mentioned)
• Attribution and credit tracking concerns
• RevOps coordination challenges
• Focused on team efficiency and rules of engagement
Validation Notes: First meeting analysis. Jerehl is a BDR leader at Rocketlane supporting 3 AEs. Shows strong operational pain points around CRM hygiene, duplicate accounts, and attribution tracking - similar to Odis persona but from SDR leadership perspective rather than RevOps. High engagement with AskElephant's automated CRM updates and objective SQL criteria. Key differentiator: he's in the trenches managing reps and hitting quota himself, not purely operations. Best match is hybrid of Odis operational concerns + Aaron's quota pressure. Recommended persona: Consider creating 'SDR/BDR Leader' persona as distinct from pure RevOps.
Validation Status: ⚠️ Partial Match (60-79%)

# Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: November 6, 2025 - Initial AskElephant product demo (practice call). Discussed CRM hygiene challenges, duplicate account issues, and attribution tracking problems at Rocketlane.

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 75% match with **Odis (Operations)**
**Secondary Traits**: Shows 40% traits of **Aaron (AE)** due to quota responsibility

**Classification Rationale**:
Jerehl exhibits strong operational concerns typical of the Odis persona - CRM hygiene, data quality, duplicate management, and RevOps coordination. However, he's not in a pure operations role. As a BDR leader with direct quota responsibility ($200k/month), he bridges the gap between tactical SDR management and operational oversight. The classification as Odis (Partial Match) reflects his operational pain points while acknowledging he's more hands-on than a typical RevOps leader. He represents a distinct persona segment: SDR/BDR Leadership.

**Evolution Observed**:

- Initially: [Baseline established - first interaction]

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**What Works** (proven in this meeting):

- Direct problem-solution framing (CRM hygiene 1 AskElephant automation)
- Addressing fairness and attribution concerns head-on
- Visual product demonstration with real examples
- Acknowledging integration gaps upfront (Nux timeline)
- Showing how solution eliminates Google Sheets workaround
- Objective SQL criteria framework resonated strongly

**What Doesn't** (to avoid):

- Don't minimize attribution concerns - this is highly emotional for him
- Don't assume RevOps will fix things - he has low trust in RevOps responsiveness
- Avoid over-promising on timeline (he asked about Nux integration timing)

**Next Steps Identified**:
