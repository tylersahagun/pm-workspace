# Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: January 5, 2025 - Initial onboarding and training call. Discussed use case for recording in-person robot demos to capture customer feedback data. Set up HubSpot sync and planned pilot with 2 sales reps.

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 75% match with Odis (Operations/RevOps)

**Secondary Traits**: Shows 40% traits of Irina (Implementation) due to hands-on technical setup

**Classification Rationale**:
Jeremy demonstrates strong operational leadership characteristics aligned with the Odis persona - managing sales operations, overseeing CRM implementation, focusing on process efficiency and scalability. However, he's more hands-on than a typical RevOps leader, directly managing HubSpot configuration and pilot programs. His role combines operational strategy with tactical execution, particularly around enabling a distributed field sales team.

- Direct, results-focused communication style
- Emphasis on practical implementation over theory
- Concerned about user adoption with field teams
- Data-driven decision making approach
- Focus on ROI and demonstrable value before rollout

**Evolution Observed**:

- Initially: Uncertain about technical feasibility for field recordings
- Currently: Confident after seeing solution, ready to pilot
- Trajectory: Moving toward controlled trial to prove value before company-wide rollout

# Aggregated Insights

**What Doesn't**:

- Don't assume remote/virtual sales model
