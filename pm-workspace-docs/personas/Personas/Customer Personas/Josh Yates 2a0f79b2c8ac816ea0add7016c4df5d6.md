# Josh Yates

AE Contact: Parthiv
Company: Fleet STS
Email: josh.yates@fleetsts.com
Persona: Aaron (https://www.notion.so/Aaron-27ff79b2c8ac80bbadfde2c62efe9691?pvs=21)

# Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: November 3, 2025 - Day 5 startup consultation call

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Aaron (Account Executive persona) with Roger (Revenue Leader) aspirational traits

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Presented as day-5 solo entrepreneur. Shows Aaron characteristics (eager to prove value, focused on closing deals) but has Roger background (former VP of Sales). Currently exhibiting Aaron behaviors due to being in startup survival mode.

**Why this classification**:
Josh transitioned from a VP of Sales role (Roger persona) to solo founder/AE role (Aaron persona). His immediate behaviors are pure Aaron - procrastinating through preparation, seeking validation, needing tactical sales coaching. However, his strategic thinking and desire to be seen as a consultant (not just reseller) shows Roger aspirations.

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns Across Meetings:**

- **Procrastination through preparation**: Building website, bank accounts, tax setup BEFORE selling anything
- **Values-driven decision maker**: Left previous VP role because company prioritized profits over team wellbeing
- **Seeks external validation**: Called Woody specifically expecting tough feedback
- **Relationship-focused**: Emphasizes partnerships, caring about people
- **Intimidated by new domains**: Admits fear around branding, marketing, social media (never posted on LinkedIn)
- **Analysis paralysis tendency**: Wants "everything laid out first" before taking action

**Evolution/Changes Noticed:**

- First meeting only - no evolution to track yet
- Transitioned from corporate VP to solo entrepreneur  (Roger  Aaron)

**Communication Preferences:**

- Appreciates direct, no-BS feedback ("I like that")
- Responds well to tough love coaching approach
- Tends to over-explain with backstory context
- Seeks frameworks and structure ("sell, design, build" resonated)
- Not on Slack, minimal social media presence
- Prefers full context before committing

# Strategic Engagement Playbook (Updated)

**Current Stage**: Pre-prospect / Early adopter candidate (not typical ICP)

**What We've Learned Works:**

- **Direct confrontation**: "So fucking go sell someone" - he appreciated bluntness
- **Simple frameworks**: "Sell, design, build" gave clear actionable structure
- **Challenge assumptions**: Pushing back on every excuse resonated
- **Personal stories**: Woody's startup journey provided credible social proof
- **Generous support without pressure**: 50% discount + immediate free access created goodwill

**What to Avoid:**

- Don't enable procrastination - he'll perfect infrastructure forever
- Don't let him explore "another part of the business" - needs singular focus
- Don't validate ideas without money - he's heard too many "great idea" responses
- Don't let him bet strategy on 1-2 conversations

**Evolving Priorities:**

1. Meeting 1 Priority: Infrastructure (bank, Stripe, website, phone system, taxes)
2. Immediate Need (post-coaching): Close first customer deal
3. Secondary Interest: Reseller partnership with AskElephant

# Key Quotes Across All Meetings

**Meeting 1**: *"I'm not even working on deals yet. I'm building out the baseline. I need a bank account in order to process."***Context**: Classic entrepreneur mistake - infrastructure before validation. Reveals psychological blocker, not technical one.

**Meeting 1**: *"I was continually being told I care too much about my team and not enough about company profit... it's not who I am."***Context**: Core values driver. Left stable VP role due to misalignment. Mission-driven over profit-driven, but might struggle with tough business decisions.

**Meeting 1**: *"I've talked to a lot of people on this before I branched off on my own."***Context**: When challenged, revealed pattern of seeking validation rather than customers. Talking instead of doing.

**Meeting 1**: *"The branding and marketing side of this is something I've never had to do. So that's the part that I'm a little intimidated on."***Context**: Genuine vulnerability about skill gaps. B2B sales/ops background, not marketing/brand building.

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions/Blockers:**

- **Woody Klemetson**: Direct coaching relationship, provides tough feedback
- **Ben Harrison**: Prior colleague from Solutionreach, strong rapport ("I like that dude so much")
- **Pete Bellison**: Will be contact for reseller program discussions

**Decision Dynamics:**

- **Authority level**: 100% (solo founder, all decisions his)
- **Key influencers**: None yet - no board, co-founders, or investors mentioned
- **Budget control**: Extremely limited - asked to defer $50/month until first deal closes
- **Will be influenced by**: Early customer validation, partnership economics, ROI proof

**Business Model Context:**

- **Core offering**: Reselling WIPAround software for fleet vehicle/equipment inspections
- **Economics**: $5/month per vehicle retail,$ 3 wholesale = $2 margin
- **Target market**: Fleet maintenance companies, forklift dealerships, construction equipment operators
- **Value proposition**: Digitizing paper-based DOT compliance inspections
- **Go-to-market**: Dual approach (direct to fleet owners + through service vendor partnerships)
- **Geographic focus**: Arizona, Nevada, California (previous employer territory)
- **Integration angle**: WIPAround connects to shop management systems to generate service requests from failed inspections

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on aggregate learnings:**

1. **DO NOT push AskElephant subscription until first deal closes** - Woody correctly gave free access but deferred payment. Josh needs to prove he can sell before investing in any tools.
2. **Accountability check-in after 2 weeks**: Ask "How many people have you pitched? How many deals closed?" - External accountability critical to overcome procrastination pattern.
3. **When first deal closes, revisit reseller partnership** - Genuine interest in reselling AskElephant to fleet service companies. Could be strategic win-win IF he proves sales ability.
4. **Push for 20+ sales conversations before building anything** - Current thinking based on 1-2 conversations. Needs much larger sample for valid offering/audience fit.
5. **Connect with Ben Harrison for ongoing support** - Existing relationship, Ben could provide coaching without consuming Woody's time.

**Watch for:**

- **Risk**: Analysis paralysis returns - will he actually sell or find new excuses?
- **Risk**: Advocacy strategy backfire - Polynesian community contact (4 vehicles) isn't ICP, could dilute focus
- **Risk**: Multiple business models - kept trying to explain "another part of the business" - must maintain singular focus
- **Risk**: Financial pressure - can't afford $50/month, might not have runway for slow ramp
- **Opportunity**: If successful, strong voice-of-customer for early-stage founder use case
- **Opportunity**: Reseller channel into fleet/industrial operations space (limited AskElephant presence)

# Persona Flexibility Note

Josh is currently operating as **Aaron** (early AE grinding to close first deals) but has **Roger** background and aspirations (former VP of Sales, wants to be strategic consultant).

**Tactical approach**: Right now he needs Aaron-focused advice - prospecting, pitch refinement, objection handling, deal velocity. Once he has initial traction (3-5 customers), he'll respond better to Roger-level strategic conversations about business model, market positioning, scaling operations.

**Key insight**: He left a Roger-level role to become an Aaron-level founder. This identity transition causes much of his hesitation. He's used to having resources, team, and infrastructure. Now he's grinding alone. Meet him where he is (Aaron struggling to make first sale) while acknowledging where he's been (Roger who led teams).

**Special consideration**: Josh is NOT a traditional ICP. He's a solopreneur, not a client-facing team at a scaling company. Woody positioned AskElephant access as:

1. Enablement tool to record his demos and improve his pitch
2. Potential reseller partnership opportunity

This is more of a strategic relationship investment than typical customer acquisition. Success metrics are different - looking for reseller channel validation and early-stage founder use case feedback, not immediate ARR.
