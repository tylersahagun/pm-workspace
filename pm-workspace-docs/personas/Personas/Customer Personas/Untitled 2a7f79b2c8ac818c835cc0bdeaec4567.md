Tools Mentioned: AskElephant
Traits That Don't Match: • Insufficient data for persona matching
Traits That Match: • No verbal participation in meeting
• Silent observer/attendee
Validation Notes: Raffi was present in the meeting but did not participate verbally. Based on context from Arthur's comments about company structure (CEO, COO, and another cofounder in Madrid moving to US), Raffi may be one of the cofounders. However, without verbal participation, role and persona cannot be determined. Requires follow-up interaction for proper classification. Meeting attendance suggests interest in AskElephant implementation but unclear if decision-maker, observer, or future user.
