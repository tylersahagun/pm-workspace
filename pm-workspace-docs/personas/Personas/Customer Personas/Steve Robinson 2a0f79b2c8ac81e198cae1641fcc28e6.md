# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 3, 2025 - AskElephant onboarding and training session

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Odis (Operations) with minor Celine (Team Management) traits

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Presented as strong Odis based on operational role, accountability focus, and systems-oriented thinking

**Why this classification**:
Steve Robinson is a Maintenance Manager at Tag and Go who demonstrates classic Odis characteristics. He operates as the connective tissue between his maintenance technicians and leadership (Quinn), focusing heavily on accountability, tracking, and ensuring smooth operational handoffs. His immediate recognition that AskElephant could "keep up accountability and everything" reveals his operational mindset. He manages field-based teams and conducts one-on-ones at job sites, requiring mobile-first solutions that don't disrupt his workflow. Like Odis, he's tech-comfortable (daily ChatGPT user), values efficiency, and seeks to eliminate administrative tasks so he can focus on supporting his team. His emphasis on tracking one-on-ones, ensuring proper documentation, and being "a better asset to the team" all align with Odis's goal of becoming the "unsung hero" through operational excellence.

    - One-on-one prep and notes
    - Stand-up meeting summaries for maintenance team
    - Action item tracking for technicians
    - Reports/digests to send to Quinn
3. **Provide templates for common scenarios**: Give Steve proven templates for:

**Watch for:**

- Opportunity: Steve may become internal champion for broader Tag and Go rollout given his tech comfort and enthusiasm
- Potential concern: If mobile app doesn't work seamlessly, could lose engagement (critical for his workflow)
- Risk: Other managers may not be as tech-savvy - Steve could be anomaly, not representative
- Expansion opportunity: If Steve finds value, likely to share with Ron and other managers, creating viral adoption

# Persona Flexibility Note

Steve exhibits Odis as his dominant type but shows Celine traits when discussing his one-on-one management approach with technicians (supporting them, helping them succeed, tracking their progress). Approach with Odis strategies (operational efficiency, accountability systems, automation) but recognize his people-management responsibilities and provide resources that help him be a better coach/supporter of his team members.
