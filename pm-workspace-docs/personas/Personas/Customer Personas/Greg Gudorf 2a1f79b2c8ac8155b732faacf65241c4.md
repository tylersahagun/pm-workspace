- Over-explaining when he's already made his decision

**Evolving Priorities:**

1. Meeting 1 Priority: Had a specific client in mind for partnership, but that client chose an alternative solution. Now in holding pattern until new opportunities arise.

# Key Quotes Across All Meetings

**Meeting 1**: "I had a client if you recall in the notes, I had a client at the time that I thought was gonna be a good match for that, but they've gone another way."
Context: Greg makes partnership decisions based on specific client needs and opportunities. His interest is tied to having concrete use cases rather than general partnership potential.

**Decision Dynamics:**

- Authority level: Appears to have full decision-making authority on partnerships

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on aggregate learnings:**

1. Schedule follow-up outreach for mid-2026 (approximately June/July) as suggested
2. When reaching back out, lead with new client success stories or use cases that might resonate

4. Focus on specific client scenarios where AskElephant solved similar problems

**Watch for:**

- New client opportunities on his end that might be good fits for AskElephant
- His role or company changes (monitor LinkedIn)
- Industry events where natural reconnection could occur

**Risk:**

- Competitor relationships may have strengthened since his client chose alternative
- Long gap between touchpoints may require re-establishing context
