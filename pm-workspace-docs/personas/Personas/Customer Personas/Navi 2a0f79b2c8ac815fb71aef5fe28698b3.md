# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 3, 2025 - Outbound call attempt (voicemail)

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Odis (Gatekeeper/Operations)

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Unable to speak directly - reached voicemail at Nava Financial. Based on limited data (voicemail greeting), tentatively classified as Odis persona.

**Why this classification**:
The voicemail greeting identifies "Nava Financial" suggesting this may be a financial operations contact. Without direct conversation, this is a preliminary classification as Odis (operations/gatekeeper role) pending actual engagement. The fact that we reached a professional voicemail system at a financial company suggests an operational or support function.

# Key Quotes Across All Meetings

**Meeting 1**: "Hi. You've reached Nava Financial. I'm sorry. Can't answer your call. If you can leave your"

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on aggregate learnings:**

1. Follow up with another call attempt or email outreach
2. When contact is established, confirm role and decision-making authority
3. Identify if Navi is the right contact or if we need introduction to another stakeholder
4. Confirm company name (TensorWave vs Nava Financial discrepancy)

**Watch for:**

- Role clarification needed - is this operations, finance, or technical contact?
- Company identity confusion - email shows tensorwave.com but voicemail says "Nava Financial"
- May be gatekeeper rather than decision maker

# Persona Flexibility Note

Currently classified as Odis (operations/gatekeeper) based on limited information from voicemail greeting and email domain discrepancy. This classification is HIGHLY TENTATIVE and should be re-evaluated upon first actual conversation. Be prepared to completely reclassify based on initial discovery call.

**⚠️ DATA QUALITY NOTE**: This entry is based solely on a voicemail greeting with no direct conversation. All assessments are preliminary and require validation through actual engagement.
