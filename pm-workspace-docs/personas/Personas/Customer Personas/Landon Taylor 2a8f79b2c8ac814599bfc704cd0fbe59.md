Key Quotes: "Every morning, I print off the calendar...I go through and I check each calendar...If they haven't accepted the invite, I send a follow-up...it's manually text from my phone." "If I knew that by default, every call has a task...there's no chance of falling through the cracks." "That would save me a decent amount of time, especially on days like this. It would save a good, you know, probably thirty minutes that day."

Traits That Don't Match: More hands-on with daily operations than typical C-suite. Still doing manual administrative tasks. Uses personal phone for prospect follow-up (not scaled yet).
Traits That Match: CEO with hands-on sales responsibilities. Revenue-focused decision making. Strategic thinker who implements tactically. Time-conscious and efficiency-driven. Direct communication style. Budget authority for tooling decisions.
Validation Notes:  | 11/13/25 Meeting: Landon listed as attendee but did not speak. Todd mentioned 'Landon's working some things out' regarding SDR team onboarding to AskElephant. Silent attendance suggests delegation mode - Todd (Marketing) handling operational implementation while Landon focuses on strategic decisions. As company grows (now outsourcing SDRs), Landon appropriately delegating product usage and workflow optimization to team members. Consistent with Roger persona's strategic focus vs tactical execution.
Validation Status: High Confidence Match
