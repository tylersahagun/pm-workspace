# Kevin Marra

AE Contact: Parker Alexander
Company: CodingScape
Email: kevin.marra@codingscape.com
Persona: Aaron (https://www.notion.so/Aaron-27ff79b2c8ac80bbadfde2c62efe9691?pvs=21)

# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 4, 2025 - AskElephant Onboarding Call (joined mid-call)

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Aaron (Primary) with Celine collaborative traits

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Strong Aaron profile—Account Executive focused on efficiency, personal improvement, and coaching insights. Proactively suggests creative use cases and volunteers to take ownership of implementation.

**Why this classification**:
Kevin is a textbook Aaron persona: an Account Executive who values autonomy, achievement, and anything that eliminates administrative burden. His immediate enthusiasm for the "STFU bot" (talk-time monitoring) reveals his self-improvement mindset and desire for coaching insights without micromanagement. He's studying sales by taking calls from other companies and analyzing Instagram ads—classic Aaron behavior of seeking any edge to improve performance.

However, Kevin also demonstrates Celine traits in his collaborative, team-oriented approach. Unlike the stereotypical lone-wolf AE, Kevin thinks about how the tool helps Kim manage the team ("where is my team stuck? what's the biggest blocker for the five people I manage?"). He volunteers to build workflows that help others, not just himself. This suggests he's either moving toward a leadership role or naturally collaborative despite being an individual contributor.

Kevin's limited call volume (2-3/week) is atypical for Aaron personas, but his behavior and motivations align perfectly with the achievement-focused, efficiency-seeking AE profile.

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns Across Meetings:**

- Highly engaged and proactive—volunteers to take lead on implementation
- Creative problem-solver who immediately sees use cases others might miss
- Self-aware about learning and improvement opportunities
- Studies best practices from other sales organizations
- Values practical, actionable workflows over theoretical benefits
- Takes ownership and commits to deliverables ("homework")
- Asks detailed technical questions to understand functionality

**Communication Preferences (learned over time):**

- Eastern Time Zone
- Prefers hands-on learning—wants to build workflows himself rather than watch demos
- Asks clarifying questions to fully understand permissions and capabilities
- Direct communication style with touch of humor
- Available Thursday mornings for deep-dive sessions

# Strategic Engagement Playbook (Updated)

**Current Stage**: Pilot User (Co-piloting with Kim for month 1)

**What We've Learned Works:**

- Giving Kevin ownership and autonomy to build workflows
- Focusing on coaching and team improvement use cases
- Emphasizing internal insights over just sales automation
- Providing specific examples of what's possible
- Letting him drive the conversation toward his priorities

**What to Avoid (learned from experience):**

- Don't assume he only cares about his personal quota—he's team-focused
- Don't overlook internal meeting use cases—he wants insights across all public meetings
- Don't treat him like typical AE with high call volume—his context is different (2-3 calls/week)

**Current Priorities:**

1. "STFU Bot" / Talk-Time Analysis: Monitor who's talking over clients and provide coaching scores
2. Positioning Agent: Track how team members present CodingScape across all public calls
3. Team Blocker Identification: Analyze meetings to surface where team is stuck, frustrated, or facing obstacles
4. Personal Coaching: Get insights on his own performance without feeling micromanaged

# Key Quotes Across All Meetings

**Meeting 1**: "I would love to see are the STFU bot because I fear a couple of our team members are constantly talking over the client. So is it possible to build out an agent like that and give Kim a you're talking over the client score?"

Context: This quote reveals Kevin's team-oriented mindset and self-awareness. He's thinking about coaching opportunities for the whole team, not just himself. The specific request shows he understands the tool's capabilities and can translate needs into technical requirements.

**Meeting 1**: "I'm in a I I I'm studying Instagram Instagram ads right now, and I'm taking 10 sales calls from random people selling me shit all the time. And you can tell who, like, really has a sales culture."

Context: Classic Aaron behavior—constantly learning from others, seeking competitive advantage, and studying what works. This explains why he's so enthusiastic about conversation intelligence tools.

**Meeting 1**: "I wanna run, like, internal workflows to analyze who's talking over the client to for him to look at all of our meetings, all of our public facing meetings, and ask something like, where is my team stuck? What is my team frustrated with? How can I remove a blocker?"

Context: Kevin thinks like a future manager even though he's currently an AE. He's focused on team success and removing obstacles—more Celine-like than typical Aaron.

**Meeting 1**: "Parker, I'd love to get some time for with you... And I for homework, I'm gonna do what I think, you know, one or two or three automations that we can build workflows that we can build that would be useful."

Context: Shows Kevin's ownership mentality and commitment to making the pilot successful. He doesn't wait to be told what to do—he volunteers and delivers.

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions/Blockers:**

- Reports to: Kim Sullivan (VP of GTM & Product)
- Relationship with Kim: Strong—Kim invited him specifically because he's "fully on board" with recording tools
- Ally: Parker Alexander (scheduled deep-dive workflow session Thursday)
- Influenced by: Kim's experience will inform his approach, but he drives his own priorities

**Decision Dynamics:**

- Authority level: User/influencer—doesn't control budget but Kim values his input
- Key influencers: If Kevin demonstrates value, Kim will expand to broader team
- Budget control: None directly, but his pilot success determines broader rollout

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on aggregate learnings:**

1. Thursday 11am ET Deep-Dive Session - Kevin's driving this. Come prepared with talk-time/interruption analysis workflow examples, positioning agent framework ready to customize, and team blocker identification workflow template.
2. Let Kevin Build 2-3 Workflows - He committed to homework. Give him the tools and autonomy to create workflows he thinks will be valuable.
3. Schedule Follow-Up - After Kevin builds initial workflows, review with both Kevin AND Kim to show what's possible
4. Connect His Calendar - Kevin needs to integrate calendar for bot to join his calls
5. Enable Manager Role - Kim wants Kevin to have full access to build workflows

**Watch for:**

- Opportunity: Kevin is natural champion—if he succeeds, he'll advocate for team adoption
- Pattern: Kevin learns by doing, not watching—give him sandbox access and let him experiment
- Risk: Limited call volume (2-3/week) means slower data accumulation—focus on quality insights over quantity
- Evolution: Kevin's team-focused thinking suggests possible promotion/leadership path—position tool as helping him demonstrate leadership capabilities

# Persona Flexibility Note

Kevin exhibits Aaron as his dominant type (AE focused on achievement, efficiency, and eliminating admin work) but shows significant Celine traits in his collaborative, team-oriented approach and desire to help others succeed. Approach with Aaron strategies around personal coaching, efficiency gains, and autonomy, but leverage his Celine side by showing how insights help Kim and the broader team—he's motivated by collective success, not just personal quota.
