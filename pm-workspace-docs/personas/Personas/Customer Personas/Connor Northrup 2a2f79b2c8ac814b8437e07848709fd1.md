Detected Role: Implementation/Onboarding
Email: connor.northrup@klasresearch.com
Key Quotes: We're hoping to have this done as soon as we can just because we haven't been able to use this with our team like we've been wanting to. So we can hopefully have it wrapped up this week.

We weren't using that limited access user, and now it's doing something that's a little bit funky, which Michael's gonna show you here.

It seems like we're we're close.

Meeting history and behavioral analysis.

# Meeting History

**Meeting 1: November 5, 2025** - KLAS | AskElephant Weekly Sync

- **Context**: Salesforce integration troubleshooting session focused on resolving workflow automation issues
- **Connor's Role**: Primary technical coordinator managing vendor relationship and implementation
- **Key Challenges Discussed**:
- Permission issues with limited access Salesforce user
- Formatting problems when writing to content notes
- Workflow node configuration
- API field mapping for rich text notes
- **Outcome**: Identified workaround using rich text field instead of direct content note creation; committed to end-of-week resolution

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 70% match with **Irina (Implementation)**

**Secondary Traits**: Shows 40% traits of **Celine (CSM)** - particularly in customer advocacy and long-term relationship focus

**Classification Rationale**:

Connor demonstrates classic Implementation persona characteristics: he's deeply involved in the technical details of getting AskElephant integrated with Salesforce, coordinates troubleshooting sessions, validates technical solutions, and acts as the bridge between his internal team and the vendor. His communication is collaborative and patient through complex technical challenges. He focuses on "getting this done as soon as we can" so his team can use the tool - typical of someone in an implementation/onboarding role who measures success by activation and adoption.

However, he lacks some typical Irina traits like structured project planning, formal change management processes, or training program development. His role seems more ongoing support than time-bounded onboarding, suggesting potential CSM overlap.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

## Consistent Patterns (Current Meeting):

- **Technical Troubleshooting Approach**: Methodically works through each potential solution, validates outcomes, and documents what works vs. doesn't work
- **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Actively involves vendor team (Yu-Chun, Jake, Matt) and internal technical contacts (Michael Butterfield)
- **Timeline-Conscious**: References team's waiting period and sets clear expectations for resolution ("hopefully have it wrapped up this week")
- **Quality-Focused**: More concerned with getting the solution right than rushing to completion

## Evolution Observed:

- **Initially**: Likely inherited a partially working solution (workflows set up by Tyler Sahagan)
- **Currently**: Actively troubleshooting regression caused by security policy changes (limited access user requirement)
- **Trajectory**: Moving from dependent on vendor support to understanding system architecture well enough to propose solutions

# Aggregated Insights

## Pain Points (Frequency):

- **Salesforce Integration Complexity** (dominant theme throughout meeting)
- Permission management challenges with limited access users
- Content note creation restrictions
- Formatting inconsistencies between AskElephant output and Salesforce display
- **Workflow Reliability** (mentioned multiple times)
- Previously working automation broke after security changes
- Need for automation to be "set and forget"
- **Time Constraints** (mentioned 2 times)
- Team waiting to use the tool
- Pressure to resolve quickly without sacrificing quality

## Goals Consistency:

- **Primary**: Get Salesforce note automation working reliably for the team
- **Secondary**: Ensure proper formatting and usability of automated notes
- **Emerging**: Build internal technical capability to troubleshoot issues independently

## Tools & Technical Environment:

- **Core Stack**: Salesforce (primary CRM), AskElephant (meeting intelligence)
- **Workflow Approach**: Prefers Salesforce Agent workflows over complex multi-node workflows when possible
- **Security Posture**: Organization requires limited access integrations (not blanket permissions)

# Strategic Engagement Notes

## What Works (proven in this meeting):

- **Collaborative Troubleshooting**: Connor responds well to real-time problem-solving sessions with screen sharing
- **Technical Explanations**: He appreciates understanding the "why" behind solutions (API names, field types, workflow logic)
- **Iterative Testing**: Comfortable with try-test-refine cycles rather than expecting perfect first-time solutions
- **Transparent Communication**: Jake and Yu-Chun's direct acknowledgment of complexity builds trust ("if workflows were easy, we wouldn't be in this call")

## What Doesn't (learned from experience):

- **Assuming Simple Fixes**: The issue required multiple attempts and approaches - premature declarations of success would damage credibility
- **Leaving Him to Figure It Out Alone**: Connor clearly values vendor partnership and collaborative resolution

## Recommended Engagement Approach:

1. **Schedule Regular Check-ins**: Connor appreciates structured weekly syncs for complex implementations
2. **Provide Documentation**: Send follow-up Looms and written examples (Jake offered this, Connor appreciated it)
3. **Set Clear Timelines**: Connor responds to commitments like "end of week update"
4. **Technical Depth**: Don't oversimplify - Connor can handle technical concepts and prefers understanding the full picture
5. **Acknowledge Complexity**: Validate that Salesforce integrations are legitimately complex - builds rapport

# Relationship Dynamics

**With Vendor Team**:

- Treats AskElephant team as partners, not vendors
- Comfortable admitting knowledge gaps
- Appreciative of support ("Appreciate the extra time")
- Advocates for solutions that work for his team

**With Internal Stakeholders**:

- References Chandler (likely manager) as decision-maker

# Next Steps for Engagement:

1. **Immediate**: Jake to add formatting guidelines to prompt and test rich text field implementation
2. **This Week**: Provide end-of-week update on resolution (committed timeline)
3. **Future**: Share documentation on multishot prompting and workflow best practices so Connor can manage future customizations
4. **Monitor**: Track if Michael Butterfield (Salesforce admin) becomes a separate persona to track - he may be an "Odis (Operations)" persona
