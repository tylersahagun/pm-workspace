# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 4, 2025 - Partner Meeting: AskElephant implementation for appointment reminders

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Aaron (The Operator)

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Presents as clear Aaron persona based on problem-solving focus, efficiency mindset, and implementation-oriented approach

**Why this classification**:
Dallin demonstrates textbook Aaron characteristics through his pragmatic, solution-focused approach to a specific business problem. He's experiencing no-shows and immediately thinks about operational efficiency through automation. Rather than asking about features broadly, he has a specific use case in mind and wants to know if it's technically feasible. His communication style is direct, friendly, and collaborative—he's not looking for a sales pitch, he's looking for a practical solution to implement. The fact that he's comfortable being directed to support chat and working through the problem independently confirms his self-sufficient, execution-oriented nature.

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns Across Meetings:**

- **Problem-first mentality**: Immediately states the business challenge (appointment no-shows) before discussing solutions
- **Implementation focus**: Questions center on "can we do this" and "how would it work" rather than "why should we"
- **Tech-comfortable**: Understands integration concepts (Outlook, HubSpot, calendar APIs) without needing basic explanations
- **Process optimizer**: Sees inefficiencies and wants to automate them away
- **Time-conscious**: Respectful of others' time, apologetic about spacing the meeting, doesn't want to waste Josh's time

**Communication Preferences (learned over time):**

- **Casual and friendly**: Uses "dude" frequently, conversational tone
- **Direct and concise**: Gets to the point quickly, no unnecessary preamble
- **Collaborative problem-solver**: Works through challenges in real-time rather than expecting answers immediately
- **Self-sufficient**: Comfortable exploring solutions independently (willing to chat with support directly)
- **Uses Outlook**: Desktop version (not web-based), frustrated with Outlook limitations compared to Google

# Strategic Engagement Playbook (Updated)

**Current Stage**: Active Customer/Partner (based on "Partner Meeting" title)

**What We've Learned Works:**

- **Give him autonomy**: He responds well to being empowered to solve things himself (directing to support chat)
- **Be solution-oriented**: Skip the pitch, get to feasibility and implementation
- **Match his casual tone**: Professional but friendly, not overly formal
- **Acknowledge limitations honestly**: Josh's transparency about not knowing if the feature exists built trust
- **Provide clear next steps**: Direction to support chat with explanation of what they can do was perfect

**What to Avoid (learned from experience):**

- Don't oversell or over-explain—he wants practical answers
- Don't make him wait for solutions he could figure out himself
- Don't dismiss his technical challenges (Outlook pain points)

**Current Priorities:**

1. **Reduce no-shows**: Primary business pain point driving this conversation
2. **Automate manual processes**: Wants pre-drafted templates sent automatically 30 minutes before appointments
3. **Personalization at scale**: Interested in leveraging HubSpot + Outlook integration for personalized reminders (not generic booking emails)
4. **Improve client experience**: Wants reminders to come from meeting confirmation with link included for easy access

# Key Quotes Across All Meetings

**Meeting 1**: "We're running into a lot of no shows for appointments we have. So I was curious if there's any way that we could set up an AskElephant agent that will go in, like, thirty minutes before, uh, an appointment on Outlook"
Context: Immediately articulates the business problem with a potential solution in mind

**Meeting 1**: "And that's also what I was hoping because it can speak with HubSpot"
Context: Demonstrates understanding of integration possibilities and sees opportunity for personalization

**Meeting 1**: "The HubSpot ones aren't great because it'll come from, like, the HubSpot one two six eight seven nine three three, something like that... So I think it just gets filtered the majority of the time."
Context: Has already tried other solutions, knows what doesn't work, and why—experience-based decision making

**Meeting 1**: "I want it to come from the appointment confirmation so it can, like, have the link right there. They can jump straight into it."
Context: User experience minded—wants to make it easy for clients, not just send a reminder

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions/Blockers:**

- **Strong relationship with Josh**: Casual rapport, jokes about being fired, comfortable admitting confusion
- **Connected to leadership**: Josh mentions checking with "Brooke" about Dallin's Slack status, suggesting visibility at leadership level
- **Partner status**: Meeting titled "Partner Meeting" suggests strategic relationship, not just customer

**Decision Dynamics:**

- **Authority level**: High autonomy—can explore and likely implement new workflows independently
- **Implementation power**: Appears to have authority to add new use cases without extensive approval
- **Self-directed**: Comfortable making decisions and taking action (will reach out to support independently)

**Tech Stack Context:**

- Currently uses: Outlook (desktop), HubSpot, Slack (deactivated for unknown reason)
- Preferred: Google Calendar (but stuck with Outlook)
- Integration needs: Calendar + CRM + Communication tools

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on aggregate learnings:**

1. **Josh to follow up via email** (not Slack—account issue) with answer from internal team about automated reminder functionality
2. **Dallin will engage support chat** directly to explore workflow building for pre-meeting reminders
3. **Priority use case**: 30-minute pre-appointment reminder automation with personalized content from HubSpot
4. **Success metric to track**: Reduction in no-show rate after implementation

**Watch for:**

- **Expansion opportunity**: If this workflow solves no-shows, Dallin likely has other operational inefficiencies he'd want to automate
- **Partner advocacy**: Strong relationship + successful implementation = potential case study/referral source
- **Technical limitations**: Outlook constraints may require creative workarounds—support team needs to deliver here
- **Slack connectivity**: Resolve the deactivated Slack issue to enable easier communication

**Immediate Action Items:**

- Josh: Email Dallin with internal team's answer about reminder functionality
- Dallin: Connect with support via in-app chat to explore workflow setup
- Support team: Prioritize Dallin's request—he's a partner and has a clear, valuable use case

# Persona Flexibility Note

Dallin is solidly Aaron (The Operator) with no significant secondary persona traits observed. He's consistent in his problem-solving, efficiency-focused, implementation-oriented approach. He may show slight **Roger** (The Analyst) traits if technical deep-dives are required, given his comfort with integration concepts, but his primary driver is operational improvement, not data analysis or strategic planning. Engage with solutions-first, practical approach, and empower him to implement independently.
