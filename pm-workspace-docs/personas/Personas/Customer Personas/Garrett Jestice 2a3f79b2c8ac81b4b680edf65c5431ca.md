Tools Mentioned: ChatGPT, Zapier
Validation Status: ❌ Poor Match (<60%)

Validation Notes:
Garrett Jestice is AskElephant's external GTM (Go-To-Market) advisory consultant from Prelude Marketing. He does NOT match any client persona because he is a service provider/consultant, not a client. This is an external advisor relationship focused on positioning, messaging hierarchy, and go-to-market strategy.

His role in this meeting was to:

- Guide positioning decisions (alternative vs. use case vs. category anchors)
- Advise on messaging architecture
- Review product marketing materials
- Provide strategic counsel on competitive positioning

This entry serves as a record of external consultant engagement, not client persona validation.

Key Quotes:

- "Positioning is about the next twelve to eighteen months. It will evolve over time."
- "The anchor already exists in the mind of your best fit prospects. You're just trying to discover what that anchor is."
- "I think you have to position against call recorders because that's what people are seeing you or comparing you against is a gong."

Traits That Match: N/A - Not a client persona

Traits That Don't Match: N/A - Not a client persona

New Traits Discovered:
This meeting revealed that AskElephant is working with external consultants for positioning work, which is a strategic investment in GTM refinement. Garrett has deep expertise in positioning frameworks and is helping guide the decision between positioning as an "alternative to call recorders" versus a "use case for CRM automation."
