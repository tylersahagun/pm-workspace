Validation Notes: Tyler is Head of Customer Success with limited participation in this workflow-focused training call. His role naturally aligns with Celine persona. Brief participation focused on understanding integration capabilities (Zoom Phone, ZoomText) which suggests he's thinking about how his CS team will use the tool. Let team members (Andy, Landon, Chris) lead technical discussions while he observed. Classic CSM behavior: supportive, focused on team enablement, concerned with integrations that affect handoffs.
Validation Status: ✅ Strong Match (80-100%)
