Validation Notes: Guy's second interaction confirms Irina (Implementation) persona with strong Odis (Operations) traits. He continues to focus on sales-to-engineering handoffs, technical data extraction, and workflow automation. New insight: he's interested in cross-client analysis and content generation from aggregate meeting data, showing more strategic operational thinking than typical implementers. Communication style remains technical, curious, and collaborative. His questions about capabilities demonstrate he's evaluating how deeply the tool can integrate into their operations.
Validation Status: Validated

# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 3, 2025 - Initial AskElephant demo and technical discovery

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Irina (Implementation) with Odis (Operations) traits

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Presents as technical co-founder focused on implementation, support, and engineering operations

**Why this classification**:
Guy is the engineering co-founder at Braided who handles all post-sales implementation and technical support. His opening statement "I'm an engineer, so I'm not really necessarily in the sales realm" immediately positioned him outside of revenue roles. However, his interests align perfectly with Irina (Implementation Specialist): he wants seamless handoffs from sales, needs complete context to execute on promises made during sales calls, and is focused on reducing manual follow-up work. His questions about querying technical details from sales calls ("What did that prospect Danny say on the call about these API endpoints?") and excitement about sales-to-engineering handoff workflows are classic Irina concerns. He also shows Odis traits with his interest in automation, workflow optimization, and his role as the technical/operational backbone of the company.

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns Across Meetings:**

- Highly technical and detail-oriented
- Focused on extracting actionable information from conversations
- Wants to reduce manual handoff processes
- Values automation and workflow optimization
- Thinks in terms of technical architecture (mermaid flowcharts, APIs, data structures)
- Concerned about post-sales execution and client support

**Communication Preferences:**

- Appreciates technical demonstrations over sales speak
- Likes to explore "how it works" rather than just "what it does"
- Asks specific, scenario-based questions
- Values practical examples with technical use cases
- Prefers to see the tool in action

# Strategic Engagement Playbook

**Current Stage**: Prospect - Agreed to 30-day pilot for 3 seats

**What We've Learned Works:**

- Showing technical use cases (API tracking, email integration, querying specific information)
- Demonstrating workflow automation and handoff processes
- Visual examples (mermaid flowcharts resonated strongly)
- Acknowledging his specific need to receive context from Jason's sales calls
- Mike's willingness to run technical scenarios built trust

**What to Avoid:**

- Don't focus too heavily on sales/revenue language - he's not in that realm
- Avoid high-level pitches without technical substance
- Don't assume he wants the same features as the sales persona

**Evolving Priorities:**

1. Meeting 1 Priority: Understanding if AskElephant can serve his engineering/implementation needs (not just sales)
2. Meeting 1 Priority: Sales-to-engineering handoff automation
3. Meeting 1 Priority: Ability to query technical information from sales calls and emails
4. Meeting 1 Priority: Reducing manual documentation and follow-up work

# Key Quotes Across All Meetings

**Meeting 1**: "I'm an engineer, so I'm not really necessarily in the sell sales realm. So I'm I'm looking at it from perspective, like, could I gain some value from it too."
Context: Immediately set boundaries - needs to understand value beyond sales use cases

**Meeting 1**: "I would love to be able to, like, hey. What did that prospect, Danny, and say on the call about these API endpoints? You know what I mean? And then it'd be able to aggregate that information."
Context: Shows his primary use case - extracting technical requirements and details from sales conversations

**Meeting 1**: "Jason can have, like, a hand off to engineering workflow that, like, provides all of the information very well organized from all of the sales and technical calls and hand it off to me just in a nice formatted way."
Context: The dream scenario - automated, comprehensive handoffs that capture everything discussed

**Meeting 1**: "I could see for something like Jason when he's given us updates in our l 10 around pipeline, he can actually start to add some, you know, AI calculated probability to deals closing."
Context: Thinks systemically about how tool benefits the whole team, not just his role

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions/Blockers:**

- Co-founder with Jason Raphael (sales/revenue) - shared decision authority
- Works closely with Ben Dittman (consultant who's championing AskElephant)
- Mentioned Laurent joining the engineering team soon - potential additional user
- Runs point on client support and post-sales implementation

**Decision Dynamics:**

- Authority level: Equal decision-maker with Jason
- Key influencers: Ben Dittman's recommendation and demonstrated use cases
- Budget control: Shared with Jason
- Decision style: Technical validation required - needs to see it work for his specific use cases
- His buy-in is CRITICAL - Jason won't proceed without Guy seeing value

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on aggregate learnings:**

1. During onboarding with Parker, prioritize Guy's technical workflows first
2. Build custom agents for:
    - API mention tracking and notification
    - Sales-to-engineering handoff summaries
    - Technical requirement extraction from sales calls
    - Email thread analysis for client support
3. Show him how to query across multiple meetings for technical patterns
4. Demonstrate Gmail integration for tracking client support threads
5. Set up mermaid diagram generation for workflow documentation

**Watch for:**

- His adoption will drive the success of this pilot
- Opportunities to add Laurent to the account when he joins
- Client support use cases beyond just sales handoffs
- Potential to use AskElephant for tracking client feature requests and bug reports

**Opportunity:**

- Guy's technical mind could help us identify new engineering/implementation use cases
- If he successfully uses it for client support, could expand beyond initial use case
- His feedback could help improve our technical persona messaging

# Persona Flexibility Note

Guy exhibits Irina (Implementation) as his dominant type but shows significant Odis (Operations) characteristics when discussing workflow optimization and automation. He's a hands-on technical founder who must bridge sales promises with engineering execution. Approach with Irina-level implementation and handoff solutions, but be ready to discuss Odis-style operational excellence and system integration. He values tools that reduce friction and manual work while improving information flow across the organization.
