Key Quotes: "The big thing we would need to be doing is looking at your BAA... Because we do have some very big clients that are very sensitive, and they wanna be blacklisted out of any AI."

"Being able to not record them is a deal breaker. Because we're not getting those recordings currently. If you could add them, it could be a value add. But if you like, being able to not record them is a deal breaker."

"We would want to lean into improvements because a lot of it is like, turnkey, easy. But we'd wanna make sure that it is an improvement on processes and systems... And not just analyzing calls, but like, doing actions off of calls."

"The other problem is we don't have people asking for what you do. They're not expressing that, but they don't know what they're missing out on either."
Last Analysis Date: November 7, 2025
Match Confidence: 8500%
Matched Persona: Roger (Revenue Leader)
New Traits Discovered: • Extremely compliance-savvy with deep knowledge of data residency requirements
• Two largest customers require data blacklisting and US-only storage
• Uses tiered licensing model (34 paid users, 36 free users across 70 employees)
• Cross-functional tool adoption philosophy - entire company in platform, not just revenue team
• Prioritizes "agentic actions" over "analytical insights" - wants automation, not just recording
• Current gap: No automated actions from call insights beyond basic follow-up emails
• Team doesn't know what they're missing - change management will be key
Observed Goals: Automate workflows, Better data security, Improve team efficiency
Observed Pain Points: Data security/compliance concerns, Limited AI-powered actions, Manual follow-up processes

Tools Mentioned: Avoma, ChatGPT, HubSpot, Notion, Zoom
Traits That Don't Match: • More hands-on than typical Roger - directly involved in tool evaluation details
• Less focused on strategic metrics/dashboards, more on operational capabilities
• Higher technical literacy than expected (understands data flows, server locations, API integrations)
• Not pushing back on price as aggressively as some revenue leaders might
Traits That Match: • Strategic thinker focused on company-wide impact (70 employees, manages multiple teams)
• Budget conscious and ROI-focused (comparing $30-35/seat Avoma vs $80/seat AskElephant)
• Security and compliance driven (BAA requirements, data sovereignty concerns)
• Process-oriented with cross-functional responsibility (Sales, CS, Product, Engineering access)
• Decision maker with authority (can make vendor switches, negotiates contracts)
• Values efficiency improvements over features ("turnkey, easy" is important)
• Long-term planning horizon (annual contracts, 60-day planning window)
Validation Notes: Mo Miller is a strong match for Roger (Revenue Leader) persona with 85% confidence. He's VP/Director-level at Rivet Health with 70 employees, evaluating AskElephant as Avoma replacement for January renewal. Key distinguishing factors:

**Authority**: Clear decision maker - can approve vendor switches, negotiate contracts, has budget ownership
**Scope**: Oversees Sales, Customer Success, Product, Marketing teams - true revenue leader span
**Focus**: Strategic efficiency gains and compliance, not tactical execution
**Concerns**: 1) BAA/data security (deal breaker), 2) Process improvements over current state, 3) ROI justification for price increase

**Critical Requirements**:
- Must pass BAA compliance review (healthcare data)
- Must support blacklisting for 2 largest customers (no international data transfer)
- Must demonstrate clear improvements over Avoma's current capabilities
- Pricing sensitivity: Currently $30-35/seat, evaluating at $80/seat

**Decision Timeline**: Avoma renewal January 5, 2025 (60 days out)

**Next Steps Needed**:
1. CTO/Compliance review of data residency and blacklisting capabilities
2. Deep dive on process improvements and automation gaps
3. ROI analysis showing value justification for price difference
Validation Status: ✅ Strong Match (80-100%)

# Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: November 7, 2025 - AskElephant Pilot Evaluation | Rivet

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 85% match with Roger (Revenue Leader)
**Secondary Traits**: Shows 25% traits of Odis (Operations) - highly process and compliance focused

**Classification Rationale**:
Mo demonstrates clear revenue leadership authority with decision-making power over vendor selection, budget allocation, and cross-functional tool strategy. His oversight spans Sales, CS, Product, and Marketing teams (70 total employees, 34 paid platform users). The strategic lens on ROI, efficiency gains, and company-wide impact aligns strongly with Roger persona. However, his deep technical involvement in compliance requirements and data architecture shows operational sophistication beyond typical revenue leaders.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Initial Meeting Patterns**:

- Leads with compliance/security as deal-breakers before discussing features
- Thinks in terms of company-wide adoption, not just revenue team
- Values automation over insights ("doing actions off calls" vs just analyzing)
- Comfortable with technical details but delegates to security team
- Uses golf/personal connection building at start of business conversations

**Decision-Making Style**:

- Methodical: Identifies deal-breakers first, then evaluates value
- Collaborative: Needs security team sign-off, considers team needs
- ROI-focused: Weighing 2.5x price increase against capability gains
- Timeline-conscious: 60-day window to make decision

# Aggregated Insights

**Pain Points (Frequency)**:

- Healthcare compliance complexity (mentioned 8+ times) - CRITICAL
- Limited automation from call insights (mentioned 3 times)
- Manual follow-up processes (mentioned 2 times)
- International data transfer restrictions (mentioned 4 times)
- Price sensitivity vs. value delivery (mentioned 2 times)

**Goals Consistency**:

- Primary: Improve process efficiency through AI automation
- Secondary: Maintain strict data security/compliance standards
- Tertiary: Demonstrate ROI to justify increased investment

**Technology Stack**:

- Current: Avoma ($30-35/seat, 34 licenses), HubSpot (tiered licensing), Zoom, Notion AI, ChatGPT (individual licenses)
- Architecture: US-only data storage required, domain-based blacklisting for top 2 customers
- Integration needs: CRM auto-update, proactive follow-up actions, cross-team tagging

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**What Works**:
✅ Leading with compliance expertise and security validation process
✅ Demonstrating agentic actions vs. passive analytics
✅ Acknowledging price difference upfront, focusing on ROI justification
✅ Understanding his cross-functional stakeholder needs (Product, CS, Engineering)
✅ Personal rapport building (golf, casual conversation)

**What Doesn't**:
❌ Glossing over compliance requirements - these are absolute deal-breakers
❌ Feature-dumping without understanding current Avoma gaps
❌ Pushing too hard on price before value is proven
❌ Ignoring the change management challenge ("team doesn't know what they're missing")

**Critical Success Factors**:

1. Pass BAA and data residency validation (via CTO Caden + Compliance Andrew)
2. Demonstrate clear process improvements over Avoma baseline
3. Show ROI model justifying $80/seat vs$ 30-35/seat
4. Prove domain blacklisting capability for sensitive customers

**Recommended Next Steps**:

1. Internal: Verify data residency, blacklisting capabilities, BAA terms with Caden (CTO) and Andrew (Compliance)
2. If compliant: Schedule deep-dive demo showing automation gaps vs Avoma
3. Prepare ROI calculator: time saved, process improvements, consolidation savings
4. Timeline: Follow up within 1 week (before November 14) to stay ahead of 60-day decision window

# Key Quotes Collection

**On Compliance (Deal-Breaker)**:
"The big thing we would need to be doing is looking at your BAA... Because we do have some very big clients that are very sensitive, and they wanna be blacklisted out of any AI, and they wanna be blacklisted."

"Their data cannot be sent international. It can never be stored on international server, which that's not an issue for you. It obviously is for Voma because Voma says they're San Diego or San Francisco based, but they're obviously India based."

"Being able to not record them is a deal breaker."

**On Value Requirements**:
"We would want to lean into improvements because a lot of it is like, turnkey, easy. But we'd wanna make sure that it is an improvement on processes and systems. And then it also does everything we're hoping to, but then it does a lot more because it's taking it all into AI."

"Not just analyzing calls, but like, doing actions off of calls. Because that's what we're not doing is actions off of any of these things other than like, follow-up emails."

**On Change Management**:
"The other problem is we don't have people asking for what you do. They're not expressing that, but they don't know what they're missing out on either."

**On Current State**:
"We have 34 paid users. And then we have 70 employees, so 36 people are accessing it for free... they're able to get into the platform, search for anything, see a whole bunch of stuff. They're just not recorded."
