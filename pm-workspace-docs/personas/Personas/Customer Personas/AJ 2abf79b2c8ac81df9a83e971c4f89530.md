Key Quotes: I'm an account manager. I'm under the CS organization... I have a 100 ish accounts that I'm responsible for. So today, that CTA is very front of mind for me. After I have 25 more customer conversations, it may not be.

The more that I can create in HubSpot, the better. Like, if I could create an upsell deal, you know, it's just updating properties, creating records.

I just want to spend more time selling and not forgetting or missing things. Among the million interactions that you're having, you just wanna make sure nothing falls through the cracks.
