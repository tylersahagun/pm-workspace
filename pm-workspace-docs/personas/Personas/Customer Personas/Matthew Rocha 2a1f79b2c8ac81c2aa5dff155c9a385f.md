# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: January 3, 2025 - Onboarding & Next Steps Call

# Persona Assessment

**Current Assessment**: Celine (The Champion) with Aaron (The Analyst) traits

**Why this classification**:
Matthew Rocha exhibits classic Champion behavior as an internal advocate who successfully sold two out of three founders on trying AskElephant. He's not the economic buyer but acts as the critical change agent driving adoption. His focus on proper onboarding, team enablement, and ensuring people actually use the tool demonstrates champion characteristics. He also shows Analyst tendencies through his hands-on approach to technical setup, working closely with ops team members (Rich and Zach) on Zapier integrations, and systematic thinking about rollout strategy.

# Initial Behavioral Insights

**Key Patterns Observed:**

- Extremely hands-on operator who believes "if I'm not hands on, people don't get onboarded"
- Manages coordination across multiple stakeholders (founders Noah and Brian, main AE Chris, ops guys Rich and Zach)
- High-urgency work style - running on minimal sleep, multiple deliverables, extensive travel
- Process-oriented with strong opinions on best practices (30-second onboarding videos, short-form content)

**Communication Preferences:**

- Direct and pragmatic communication style
- Appreciates efficiency and actionable next steps
- Values being included even when not technically necessary
- Prefers to coordinate team calendars and orchestrate group involvement

**Role & Responsibilities:**

- Appears to be in a RevOps or Go-to-Market Operations role
- Has calendar access and coordination authority for team
- Works with ops team on technical integrations
- Has consulting background with early-stage go-to-market organizations
- Manages vendor evaluation and internal change management

# Strategic Engagement Playbook

**Current Stage**: New Customer - 1 Month Pilot (5 seats approved)

**What Works:**

- Showing understanding of his operational burden and offering to extend trial period
- Being flexible on scheduling around his team's availability
- Acknowledging his expertise and process recommendations (30-second video idea)
- Providing practical solutions to concerns (50 Grain calls migration for pilot)
- Making his seat free so he can oversee without counting against budget

**What to Avoid:**

- Assuming he needs basic onboarding (he already knows the product)
- Creating additional work for him during onboarding
- Ignoring his process recommendations - he has strong opinions based on experience
- Pushing for decisions without giving him time to coordinate stakeholders

**Current Priorities:**

1. **Seamless team adoption** - Wants everyone properly onboarded and using the tool
2. **Data preservation** - Concerned about losing 1.5 years of Grain recordings (CEO priority)
3. **Workflow automation** - Solving messy handoffs between teams
4. **Stakeholder inclusion** - Getting MCP per client basis with stakeholder involvement
5. **Mobile accessibility** - Values the mobile app as differentiator

# Key Quotes from Meeting 1

**On his role and approach**: "I have ops flashbacks of, like, if I'm not hands on, then, like, people don't get onboarded."
Context: Explains why he wants to attend onboarding despite not needing it - he's the internal driver of adoption

**On internal selling**: "I kinda sold. Maybe I overpromised some stuff. But, like, I sold Noah and Brian, the two cofounders, on this to the viable option."
Context: Reveals his champion role and self-awareness about advocacy

**On process best practices**: "I don't know why more people don't have this, frankly... just have a thirty second or less video. Everybody loves TikTok. Everybody loves short form content."
Context: Shows his consulting experience and strong opinions on onboarding best practices

**On workload**: "I'm running on, like, twenty... When did I last get to sleep? Saturday night? So, yeah, I've just been just been going."
Context: High-pressure, high-output operator in early-stage environment

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions/Blockers:**

- **Allies**: Noah and Brian (two out of three founders approved)
- **Key Influencer**: Chris (main AE) - "his opinion's gonna matter pretty heavily... first AE, first hire outside founders for go to market"
- **Technical Partners**: Rich and Zach (ops guys, "Wayne's World guys" who work together, set up Zapier)
- **Unknown**: Third founder not yet consulted
- **Economic Buyer**: Likely Noah (can give CRM access, technical permissions)

**Decision Dynamics:**

- **Authority level**: Can approve 1-month pilot and put $500 on his credit card, but needs founder approval for full commitment
- **Key influencers**: Chris (AE) needs to see value beyond current ChatGPT workflow with Brian
- **Budget control**: Direct control for pilot, influence for full purchase

# Team Composition & Use Cases

**Planned 5-Seat Distribution:**

1. Matthew Rocha (oversight/coordination)
2. 1-2 Founders (Noah and/or Brian)
3. 1-2 Salespeople (including Chris, main AE)
4. Rich (ops guy, resourceful type)
5. Potentially Zach (second ops guy) or sales rep

**Use Case Focus:**

- **Primary**: Fix messy handoffs between teams (SDR  AE  CSM cycle)
- **Secondary**: Automation workflows off meeting data
- **Tertiary**: Stakeholder/client relationship tracking (MCP per client)

# Technical Environment & Migration

**Current Stack:**

- Using Grain for call recording (1.5 years of recordings)
- Zapier for integrations (set up by Rich and Zach)
- ChatGPT workflows (Chris and Blake use with Brian)
- CRM access controlled by Noah

**Migration Needs:**

- 50 calls from Grain for pilot (specific customer lifecycles)
- Full migration contingent on commitment post-pilot
- Integration setup needed before onboarding call

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Immediate Actions:**

1. ✅ Send invoice for 5 seats ($500) - Matt will pay on credit card
2. ✅ Create 30-second Loom video explaining AskElephant
3. ✅ Send video to all onboarding attendees before call
4. ✅ Set up Matt's account early so he can configure with Noah pre-onboarding
5. ✅ Migrate 50 Grain calls for pilot testing
6. ✅ Schedule onboarding: Tuesday, January 11, 4-5pm CST

**For Onboarding Call (Erica leading):**

- Focus on use case: handoff automation workflows
- Address Chris's concern: "What specific automations do they have? Blake and I have pretty solid workflow with Brian and ChatGPT"
- Demonstrate superiority over manual ChatGPT copy/paste workflow
- Show LLM flexibility (GPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini, Llama)
- Get integrations configured with Noah beforehand

**Watch for:**

- Chris (main AE) skepticism - needs to see "more than marginally better" than current process
- Third founder's input - two out of three approved, need full buy-in
- Matt's bandwidth - he's running on fumes, make everything effortless for him
- Data migration expectations - CEO doesn't want to lose Grain recordings

**Engagement Strategy:**

- Treat Matt as internal partner, not typical customer
- Leverage his consulting expertise and process insights
- Reduce his workload wherever possible (pre-configure, automate, simplify)
- Ensure team adoption happens smoothly to validate his internal advocacy
- Position success metrics around handoff improvement and workflow automation

# Persona Flexibility Note

Matthew operates primarily as a Champion (Celine) - the internal advocate driving adoption and managing change. However, he exhibits strong Analyst (Aaron) characteristics when dealing with technical implementation and process design. Approach him as a strategic partner who understands both the business value proposition and technical requirements. He'll champion the solution internally if onboarding is smooth and the team sees value quickly. His credibility is on the line after "maybe overpromising" to founders, so deliver on automation and handoff improvements immediately.
