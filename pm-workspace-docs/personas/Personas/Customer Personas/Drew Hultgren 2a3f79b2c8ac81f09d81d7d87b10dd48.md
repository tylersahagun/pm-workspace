Key Quotes: On team dynamics: She's my boss, so that's funny. I won't speak for John. On reorganization: We haven't made any changes yet, so the groups are accurate as they need to be today. That'll probably be December, I'd imagine or Jan. On capacity planning: I have another person I'm moving into more of a systems focused role in 2026. We're not quite at the place where she has the capacity to take on I just threw, like, three other things at her for between now and end of the year. On delegation: I wouldn't have Matt be part of these because I think Matt can tell you what he wants... John's sort of our go to builder right now.

Trusts John as the go-to builder and primary operator. Makes strategic decisions about team structure, seat allocation, and timing while letting operators drive tactical execution. Current Priorities - Organizational reorganization (Dec 2025/Jan 2026), Adding systems-focused team member in 2026, Managing team capacity and bandwidth, Overseeing AskElephant partnership at strategic level. Decision-Making Authority - Controls seat allocation and paid access decisions, Determines meeting participation and team involvement, Plans organizational structure and role assignments, John reports to Drew directly.

Next Steps - Drew approved biweekly meetings between Jasmin and John. Will be informed of progress but not expected to attend regularly unless strategic decisions needed. Data Limitation Note - Assessment based primarily on positional authority and brief strategic inputs. Future meetings may reveal stronger Roger characteristics.
