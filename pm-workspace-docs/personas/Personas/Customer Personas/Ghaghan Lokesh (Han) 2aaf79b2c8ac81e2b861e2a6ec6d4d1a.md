# Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: November 13, 2025 - Initial discovery call with Mike Haimowitz (15-minute slot, went 35+ minutes). Brought colleague Malaika. Discussed LinkedIn strategies, AskElephant product capabilities, and pain points around SDR coaching at scale.

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 65% match with Aaron (AE)

**Secondary Traits**: Shows 30% traits of Roger (Revenue Leader) - strategic thinking about team-wide solutions

**Classification Rationale**:
While Ghaghan is an SDR rather than an AE, his pain points and motivations align most closely with Aaron's persona. He's quota-driven (team sprint of 200 meetings in 10 weeks), focused on performance improvement through better coaching/tools, and demonstrates strong tech adoption mindset. Key difference: position in sales cycle (prospecting vs closing) and authority level (influencer vs decision maker). However, champion characteristics make him valuable for multi-threaded sales approach.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Consistent Patterns** (Initial meeting):

- Highly engaged and curious (asked about Mike's LinkedIn journey and sales performance)
- Quick to understand product value ("I really think this is a great tool")
- Proactive about next steps (committed to connect with manager Vishnu)
- Community-oriented (part of Sales 1-1 community, willing to advocate publicly)
- Works collaboratively (brought colleague Malaika to call)
- Relationship-first approach (casual banter, asked about cooking, referenced previous DMs)

**Evolution Observed**:

- Initially: Connected via LinkedIn based on Mike's content ("Your content is good. That's why you're connecting with fellow SDRs")
- Currently: Progressing from interested prospect to internal champion
- Trajectory: Moving toward manager introduction and potential LinkedIn advocacy

# Aggregated Insights

**Pain Points (Frequency)**:

1. Lack of coaching/feedback - CRITICAL (mentioned 4+ times)
    - "We have one SDR manager for 22 of us"
    - "We make 75-100 calls a day. You can't get feedback on all of them"
    - "All of us don't get any support, we just go to him on a weekly basis"
2. Language/terminology barriers - HIGH (mentioned 2 times)
    - "Not really well versed with the whole American education system"
    - "I say tutoring, they say instruction"
3. Tool limitations - MEDIUM
    - Company building in-house solution (threat/opportunity)
    - Using multiple disconnected tools

**Goals Consistency**:

- Primary: Get scalable coaching and feedback for large SDR team
- Secondary: Improve call performance and conversion rates
- Emerging: Help manager (Vishnu) scale effectiveness across team

**Tech Stack**:

- CRM: Salesforce
- Sales Engagement: Outreach
- Call Recording: Gaia
- Communication: Slack, Gmail
- In Development: Custom AI call analysis tool (competitive threat)

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**What Works** (proven in this meeting):

- LinkedIn content-driven relationship building (Mike's "ant man" brand)
- Casual, authentic conversation style (cooking, motorcycle accident, time zones)
- Demonstrating specific use cases for their pain (language flagging workflow idea)
- Offering hands-on trial (call recording with AI chat feature)
- Building multi-threaded relationships (including Malaika)
- Addressing build vs buy directly (ROI on engineering time)

**What Doesn't**:

- N/A - first meeting, all positive

**Competitive Context**:

- Quizizz has AI team building internal call analysis tool
- Current tools: Gaia for recording, Outreach has AI features
- Differentiation needed: Aggregate analysis, team-wide insights, workflow customization

**Next Steps & Commitments**:

1. Mike to follow up tomorrow (Nov 14) - CONFIRMED
2. Ghaghan to contact manager Vishnu about December meeting - IN PROGRESS
3. Ghaghan considering LinkedIn post Saturday - PENDING (Mike won't be available Saturday)
4. Ghaghan to share in Sales 1-1 community - COMMITTED
5. Check SpotRoute connection for another potential intro - PENDING

# Key Stakeholders

**Fit Score**: 7/10
