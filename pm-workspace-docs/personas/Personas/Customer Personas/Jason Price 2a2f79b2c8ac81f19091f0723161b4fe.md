Tools Mentioned: AskElephant, Gong, HubSpot, Notion
Traits That Don't Match: • Not a traditional revenue leader managing a sales team • Runs a dev shop, not a typical sales organization • Doesn't use CRM (only spreadsheet) - very unconventional • Only works 4-5 deals at a time (low volume, high touch) • 99.9% referral-based (not outbound focused)
Traits That Match: • Business owner/decision maker with full authority • Strategic thinker focused on efficiency and automation • Values AI-forward solutions • Partnership and referral-focused business model • Tech-savvy and early adopter mindset • Presents at conferences (thought leader)
Validation Notes: Jason is a unique persona - business owner of a 25-person dev shop (Orchard Tek) who operates more like a technical founder than traditional revenue leader. He's highly AI-literate (avid Claude user, used Gong historically, bought Plaud device) and has built manual AI workflows for meeting intelligence. His business is 99.9% referral-based with only 4-5 active deals at a time. He's seeking AskElephant for: 1) Personal use to validate the product, 2) Client referrals (does dev work for salesai.com), 3) Advocacy opportunities (mentioned AskElephant at recent conference). Primary partnership goal is mutual referral exchange with Pete. Most matches Roger persona for strategic decision-making authority but shows strong Odis traits around process optimization and AI adoption.
Validation Status: ⚠️ Partial Match (60-79%)

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 75% match with Roger (Revenue Leader)
**Secondary Traits**: Shows 30% traits of Odis (Operations) - strong focus on automation and process efficiency

**Classification Rationale**:
Jason is classified as Roger primarily due to his role as business owner and ultimate decision maker with full authority over his 27-person company. However, he's an unconventional Roger - he's a technical founder running a dev shop rather than a traditional sales organization. His strategic thinking about partnerships, tool selection, and business efficiency aligns with Roger, but his hands-on approach to AI implementation and process automation shows significant Odis characteristics.
