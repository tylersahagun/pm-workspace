Persona: Aaron (https://www.notion.so/Aaron-27ff79b2c8ac80bbadfde2c62efe9691?pvs=21)

# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 3, 2025 - AskElephant Onboarding Session with Erika Vasquez

# Persona Evolution

Current Assessment: Aaron (Account Executive/Sales Leader) with Odis (Operations) traits

Persona Journey: Meeting 1 presented primarily as Aaron persona - early-stage sales team member focused on driving growth, improving conversion metrics, and using tools to save time. Shows strong Odis traits through interest in automations, HubSpot integrations, and systematic workflow optimization.

Why this classification: Nate is one of the first founding hires on the sales team at CloudRig, positioning him in a sales leadership capacity typical of Aaron personas. His primary focus is on improving conversion metrics and using tools like ChatGPT to pull together information from demos - classic Aaron behaviors of leveraging technology to maximize selling efficiency. However, he shows significant Odis characteristics through his deep interest in HubSpot automations, workflow setup, and his methodical approach to testing the tool before rolling it out team-wide. His comment about wanting to save time and bring the whole team onto it suggests he's thinking operationally about scale and efficiency, not just individual quota attainment. This hybrid profile makes him a powerful champion - he understands both the sales execution and the operational infrastructure needed for success.

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

### Consistent Patterns Across Meetings

- Extremely action-oriented and efficiency-focused
- Methodical in approach: test it first, then roll out to team
- Direct communication style with specific, immediate asks
- Strong technical curiosity despite security constraints
- Proactive about asking questions and removing blockers
- Located in North Denver, Mountain Time zone
- Pragmatic about tool adoption - wants to see value before committing

### Communication Preferences

- Preferred communication style: Direct, fast-paced, focused on actionable next steps
- Response patterns: Asks clarifying questions immediately when confused
- Follow-up preference: Wants clear action items with ownership

# Strategic Engagement Playbook

Current Stage: New Customer - Onboarding Phase (Individual Testing Before Team Rollout)

### What Works

- Lead with efficiency gains and time savings messaging
- Show don't tell - responds well to live demos
- Provide specific examples tied to his use cases
- Be upfront about limitations or requirements
- Move at his pace

### What to Avoid

- Don't assume admin access - CloudRig implementing enterprise security
- Avoid overwhelming with too many workflows at once
- Don't make assumptions about technical setup

### Evolving Priorities

1. Initial: Time savings and team efficiency
2. Secondary: Sales coaching and conversion improvement
3. Emerging: HubSpot integration and automation (currently blocked)

# Key Quotes

"We're using ChatGPT a lot for pulling together information from demos and stuff like that. And I think we could do all that in AskElephant as well."

Context: Shows he's already using AI tools proactively and sees the value proposition immediately. This is an adoption accelerator.

"We're trying to do some new security things. Like, we're selling to some enterprise customers, and we have to have high security for some of these."

Context: Critical insight into organizational constraints. CloudRig is moving upmarket, which affects how we implement and what permissions are required. This is a real blocker that needs resolution.

"Can we kill the churn alert? We don't need that one right now."

Context: Decisive and clear about what's not relevant. Doesn't want noise or clutter. Values focused, targeted workflows that match his current needs.

"Just let me know about the HubSpot stuff, and we'll get that set up as soon as possible."

Context: HubSpot integration is a high priority for him. This is likely where he sees the biggest efficiency gains and automation value.

# Relationship Intelligence

### Internal Champions/Blockers

- Champion: Nate himself testing before team rollout
- Previously met with: Ruben (earlier sales/discovery conversation)
- Potential blocker: HubSpot admin (unnamed) controls integration permissions due to security protocols
- Reporting structure: Appears to be senior enough to make tool decisions for sales team

### Decision Dynamics

- Authority level: High influence over sales tools and processes, testing for team adoption
- Decision approach: Test first, prove value, then scale to team
- Budget control: Likely has approval or strong influence on sales tooling budget
- Key influencers: Admin team (for security/permissions), leadership (for team rollout approval)

# Next Steps & Recommendations

### Based on aggregate learnings

1. URGENT: Provide specific HubSpot permission requirements (Erika committed to following up with James)
2. Set up customer-quotes Slack channel workflow (completed during call - monitor for quality)
3. Friday 1PM follow-up: Gather feedback on workflow outputs and iterate based on his preferences
4. Once HubSpot connected: Build custom automation workflows for his specific CRM fields
5. Document which coaching outputs work best for him (rating scales, methodology preferences)
6. After successful individual testing: Create team onboarding plan for CloudRig sales team rollout

### Watch for

- Security/compliance concerns that might affect other integrations or features
- Signs that workflows need adjustment (he was quick to delete churn alert - monitor for other friction)
- Feedback on coaching workflow methodology - he may want customization
- Timeline for team rollout - this could expand the account significantly
- Other team members he brings into conversations (signals buying committee)

### Critical Success Factors

- Resolve HubSpot integration blocker ASAP
- Demonstrate measurable time savings during test period
- Show clear coaching/conversion improvement insights
- Make it easy for him to advocate internally for team rollout
- Maintain his preferred pace and communication style

# Persona Flexibility Note

Nate exhibits Aaron (Account Executive) as his primary persona - he's sales-focused, efficiency-driven, and motivated by conversion improvements and quota attainment. However, he shows strong Odis (Operations) traits when discussing integrations, automations, and systematic rollout to his team. This hybrid profile means he thinks like a seller but acts like an operator. Approach with Aaron's efficiency and results messaging, but deliver with Odis-level attention to process, integration quality, and scalability. He's the ideal early adopter who can bridge individual usage and team-wide implementation.

## Critical Context: CloudRig Company

CloudRig is in growth mode with Nate as one of the early sales hires helping scale the team. The company is currently:

- Selling to enterprise customers - moving upmarket
- Implementing high security requirements for enterprise deals
- These security protocols affect integration capabilities and admin permissions
- Nate's role involves both individual sales execution and operational planning for team scale

💡 Follow-up Scheduled: Friday, 1PM MT - Feedback session to iterate on workflows and gather user experience insights before potential team-wide rollout
