# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: Nov 4, 2025 - SDR Role Interview with Andrew Brown

# Persona Assessment

**Context**: RECRUITMENT INTERVIEW - Charles is a job candidate for SDR position, not a client.

**Match**: Aaron persona (sales role) BUT key difference - sales is means to end, not passion. True goals: Open coffee shop or photography business.

# Background

**Recent**: Common Room SDR (4 months), let go Nov 3 after missing quota 3 straight months (50%, 12.5%, 62.5%)
**Previous**: Gong, Pipedream, Flex (strong: 80-120% quota), Hootsuite
**Pre-tech**: Bartender 6 yrs, real estate, barista, theater

# Interview Insights

**Red flags**: Slow to adapt when failing, initially deflected blame, 4-5 month tenure pattern
**Positives**: Coachable, self-aware when pushed, entrepreneurial, strong when fit is right

# Personal

KC resident, married with homeschooled kids, considering CA move. Views SDR as tool to learn business and build wealth for future coffee shop/photography business.

# Fit Assessment

**Risk**: Sales is transactional not vocational. High turnover likelihood. Andrew noted misalignment between Charles's goals and AskElephant's mission-driven culture.

**Quote**: "I wanna be a good father and husband... I would love to open up a coffee shop one day... It gives me time to be at home with my kids building up the wealth to start that company a few years down the road."

**Recommendation**: PROCEED WITH CAUTION - Retention concerns

# Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: 2025-11-04 - Initial conversation (referenced, prior to this meeting)
- **Meeting 2**: 2025-11-07 - Technical interview with Adia Toll (SDR Manager) - 1hr+ deep dive into sales approach, background, and readiness for AskElephant

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 75% match with **Aaron (AE)**

**Secondary Traits**: Shows developing characteristics but currently sits between SDR (current) and AE (aspiring)

**Classification Rationale**:

Charles is interviewing for an SDR role but demonstrates many Aaron (AE) characteristics in mindset and ambition. He's results-driven, competitive ("hate to lose"), and increasingly focused on quality conversations over volume. His 3 years of sales experience across Hootsuite, Gong, Pipedream, Flex, and Common Room shows progression, though he's still developing the confidence and consistency of a typical Aaron. Recent layoff from Common Room has created a chip on his shoulder and heightened self-awareness about needing to change approach from volume-focused to relationship-focused selling.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Core Strengths**:

- **Work ethic**: Made 9,800 dials in 4 months at Common Room
- **Self-awareness**: Openly acknowledges need to improve discovery, confidence, qualification
- **Coachability**: Craves feedback, emotional about receiving first real coaching in 2 years
- **Network-focused**: Leveraged referrals (Nate Hipoff at Common Room), builds genuine LinkedIn connections (4,000+)
- **Service mentality**: 6 years bartender/bar manager background brings customer-first approach

**Development Areas**:

- **Insecurity patterns**: Sells from insecurity when environment isn't stable, struggles with impostor syndrome
- **Volume addiction**: Historically relied on "do more" vs "do better" - 120+ dials/day at Gong, exceeded KPIs everywhere
- **Anxious behaviors**: Admits to being "high energy, doesn't like to sit still" which can be reactive vs strategic
- **Delayed self-reflection**: Admits he waited too long at Common Room to change approach despite poor results

**Evolution Observed**:

- **At Hootsuite** (first SDR role): Sponge mentality, won dial spiff with pure volume
- **At Gong**: Trusted the process, plug-and-play sequences, 120 dials/day quota
- **At Pipedream**: First taste of quality over quantity (100 dials/week), deep account research
- **At Flex**: Poor leadership, no coaching, political drama affected performance
- **At Common Room**: Wake-up call - 4.4% connect rate, didn't hit quota, finally confronted bad habits. Manager Sarah helped him find confidence and storytelling. September was turning point with Flashpoint meeting where he learned to be human and have fun.

# Trajectory**: Moving from volume SDR  quality-focused SDR  future AE. Ready for AskElephant's conversation-focused approach (20 conversations/day vs 200 dials/day).

# Aggregated Insights

**Pain Points (by severity)**:

1. **Lack of quality coaching** (mentioned emotionally - "teared up" after first real call review at Common Room)
2. **Volume-over-quality pressure** - Every past role pushed activity metrics over outcome quality
3. **Missing context/poor systems** - Common Room gave him pre-written sequences that didn't work, told to "trust the process"
4. **Insecurity when environment is unstable** - Flex political drama and Common Room uncertainty impacted selling
5. **Tool fragmentation** - Has used many tools but not strategically integrated

**Goals Consistency**:

- **Primary**: Prove himself after layoff, be a top performer again, get promoted to AE within 6 months
- **Secondary**: Master quality discovery, develop authentic sales voice, build sustainable process
- **Emerging**: Lead with relationships and referrals vs cold outreach, use AI strategically

**Key Success Story** - Flashpoint Meeting (September):

Charles booked VP of Marketing Strategy & Operations at Flashpoint via LinkedIn. Had banter about sales/marketing friction, pushed back when prospect challenged him about naming names, built rapport over Anthony Hopkins movie reference. Prospect said "This is probably gonna be a shock, but I'd be happy to take a meeting. I think you did a good job." This was catalyst moment where Charles realized he needs to "have fun, be human, dig deeper, push back."

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**What Works** (proven approaches):

- **Challenge him directly** - Adia pushed "If I called Sarah, how would she feel?" and he responded well without defensiveness
- **Give homework with clear outcomes** - Responded positively to assignment: read "Science of Scaling", create 20-conversation-per-day plan
- **Acknowledge the chip on his shoulder** - He needs to feel his frustration/anger about layoff is valid fuel for change
- **Connect to hospitality background** - He relates sales to service: "You're doing my job for me" when customers are specific

**What Doesn't Work** (patterns to avoid):

- **Empty reassurance** - Hates "trust the process" or "just do what you're doing"
- **Volume-only metrics** - Will fall into bad habits if only measured on activities vs conversations
- **Gossipy/political environments** - Last manager at Flex "gossiped about team" which shut Charles down
- **Plug-and-play sequences** - Needs autonomy to personalize and make messaging his own

**Red Flags to Monitor**:

- **Anxious urgency** - Reached out to Adia same day as layoff, admitted timing was off
- **Needs external validation** - Looking for manager who "won't let him fail"
- **Paralysis by analysis** - "Very analytical person" who can get stuck overthinking
- **Introvert in extrovert role** - Admits family are all extroverts, he's learning to "take up space"

**Interview Process**:

- ✅ Andrew interview - Culture fit (Adia noted Andrew was "really impressed")
- ✅ Adia interview (this meeting) - Technical SDR skills and systems thinking
- 📅 Ben Kennard interview scheduled (Monday) - AE potential evaluation

**Next Steps Given**:

1. Read "The Science of Scaling" before Monday
2. Create plan for having 20 conversations/day consistently
3. Find an AI use case Adia hasn't thought of yet

- "I have three years of sales experience. I need to start acting like I have three years of sales experience."
- "I'm somebody who I was asked not too long ago if I love to win or hate to lose. And I'm on the hate to lose side of things. I don't really have to win. I don't care to be number one all the time, but I'm not gonna lose."
- "Because I was failing so badly, it caused me to finally accept what I was doing wrong and challenge it."
- "I'm an introvert, and my family is a bunch of extroverts. And so I didn't always have a voice speaking up... One thing that I'm learning now is to take up space."

**On Volume vs Quality Realization**:

- "I made just shy of 9,800 dials in the four months I was at Common Room."
- "When I got into sales, my belief was if I hit my KPIs and or if I exceed my KPIs, the meetings will come."
- "I had a 4.4% connect rate, give or take, and I was only getting 15 to 20 conversations a week, not a day."
- "Where it's gonna feel uncomfortable for me is the challenge of not just doing high volume for the sake of doing high volume and hitting KPIs, but doing high volume that's actually gonna convert to conversations."

**On Common Room Experience**:

- "Florin's response was, 'Well, why didn't you just use our messaging? We're pretty plug and play here.' And I had to bite my tongue and say the messaging isn't working."
- "I actually teared up and cried after my first call review with Florin on my third week at common room because for the last two years, I haven't gotten any coaching."
- "Nate texted me the day I got laid off that he was sorry that he got me the job, and it was probably the worst time to join the company."

**On Sales Philosophy Evolution**:

- "I need to have fun here. I need to be human. I need to dig deeper. I need to push back. I need to challenge the way that they're thinking."
- "I like to use email as an anchor point that even if I call and they don't answer, I'll leave a voice mail and say, 'I sent you an email. This is the subject line. I'm gonna send you a LinkedIn connect.' Try to trace everything back together, multithread."

**On Why AskElephant**:

- "Part of what caught my attention and why I reached out to you initially was I saw that you guys were doing something different. You guys are doing something that I know that I can do but would make me feel uncomfortable."
- "In our conversations with you, you've always either given me critique or feedback that challenged me and challenged my belief of what I was doing, and you've also left me with something to think about at the end of the conversation."

**Adia's Challenge** (closing quote):

- "Am I gonna let what's comfortable dictate revenue? Am I going to let this thing, what feels comfortable to me, be what dictates who I become?"
