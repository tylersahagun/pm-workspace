# Key Quotes

> 
> 
> 
> "Definitely, the highest success rate is cold calling in, you know, this field or if you can go to shows."
> 
> "To be honest with you, I don't think they'd be interested in it because the main problem they're having...We're really, really struggling with leads."

# Strategic Context

Current Stage: Prospect - Not qualified. Brandon's company needs lead generation solutions, not call analysis. No CRM infrastructure. Buyers (maintenance managers) prefer phone calls over meetings. Cold calling and trade shows are primary channels. Low buying authority as IC. Positive relationship established for future opportunity.

# Next Steps

1. Monitor Brandon's LinkedIn activity from 15-15-10-1 strategy
2. Engage with his content to stay top of mind
3. Watch for CRM implementation or career moves
4. Quarterly value-add touchpoint without sales pressure
5. Potential referral source for better-fit prospects
