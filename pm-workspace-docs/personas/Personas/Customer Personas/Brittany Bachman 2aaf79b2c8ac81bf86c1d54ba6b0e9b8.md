Tools Mentioned: AskElephant, HubSpot
Traits That Don't Match: • Less data/analytics focused than typical Odis persona
• More hands-on with implementation vs. strategic oversight
• Team members are 'not tech savvy' project managers (field team) vs. typical ops team
• Use case is mobile app-based field recordings vs. typical office-based operations
Traits That Match: • Focused on operational efficiency and workflow automation
• Managing team implementation and adoption challenges
• Direct communication style focused on solving problems
• Time-constrained and looking for scalable solutions
• Coordinates between technical systems (HubSpot integration)
• Responsible for workflow setup and team rollout
Validation Notes: First implementation check-in call. Brittany is struggling with time constraints and hasn't completed workflow setup despite onboarding. Key use case: Field team using mobile app to record walk-throughs and auto-create HubSpot deals with project scope. Workflow already built but not activated due to missing HubSpot connection. Team consists of non-technical project managers who need hands-on training. Brittany prefers AskElephant team to handle workflow creation rather than DIY. Next steps: Connect HubSpot, activate 'create deal from walk through' workflow, schedule team onboarding session.
