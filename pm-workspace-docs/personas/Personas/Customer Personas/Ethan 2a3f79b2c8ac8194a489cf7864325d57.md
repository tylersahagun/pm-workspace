Key Quotes: • 'If you guys connect to Concert, I'm buying it. Like so when you have it done, I'm just tell me, and I'll buy it because that would be super super beneficial.'
• 'I'm not looking for, like, a brain, if you will, for, like, our data. I'm looking for something that would feed into another tool based off of a specific prompt.'
• 'I don't have the bandwidth to train them. I don't wanna hire SDR managers... So this would benefit, you know, my clients and not just greater scale.'

Tools Mentioned: Canva, Clay, Concert, HubSpot, RingCentral, Slack, Zapier, n8n
Traits That Don't Match: • More technical than typical Roger persona - understands no-code platforms (n8n)
• Already has tech stack solutions in place - looking for specific gaps
• Less focused on high-level strategy, more on tactical implementation
• More cautious about adoption - needs proof of value before commitment
Traits That Match: • Founder/CEO with strategic technology focus
• Heavy focus on ROI and immediate business value
• Looking for scalable solutions that benefit multiple clients
• Evaluates tools through lens of operational efficiency
• Values integration capabilities and API access
• Makes decisions based on specific use cases and concrete value
Validation Notes: **Meeting Context**: Discovery call with Reuben (AskElephant)

**Primary Insight**: Ethan is a founder of Greater Scale, a go-to-market firm with ~10 people offering AI agent development and SDR services. He has 3 SDRs for Greater Scale and several more for client work.

**Key Decision Driver**: Concert auto-dialer integration is the make-or-break feature. Will purchase immediately if this integration exists.

**Secondary Pain Point**: Creating statement of works takes 1-2 hours per week - looking for automation via meeting recorder that connects to n8n workflow.

**Technical Sophistication**: Uses n8n for no-code workflows, understands API integrations, wants AskElephant as 'brain' that feeds other tools.

**Current State**: Uses HubSpot free version for warm leads only (manual), Slack huddles for internal meetings, manual notes for sales calls, Concert for auto-dialing, RingCentral for manual follow-ups.

**Decision Timeline**: On hold until Concert integration available - will move forward immediately once confirmed.
