# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: October 31, 2025 - Weekly Partner Sync (minimal participation, presence noted)

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Celine (Executive Sponsor) - PRELIMINARY

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Limited direct participation, but contextual indicators suggest executive oversight role

**Why this classification**:
David's classification as Celine is preliminary based on contextual evidence rather than direct participation. He was mentioned by Andrew in context of legal/technology agreement review ("I'll ask David... He was supposed to have that be looked at this week and red line this stuff"), suggesting executive authority over contracts and legal matters. His presence on the call without active participation is typical of executive sponsors who monitor strategic partnerships without getting involved in tactical discussions. More observation needed to confirm.

3. **ONGOING**: Monitor participation level in future partnership meetings
4. **VALIDATION**: Confirm role, title, and decision-making authority

**Engagement Strategy:**

- Topics that prompt his involvement
- Communication style and preferences

**Critical Gap:**
This profile requires significant development. David had minimal participation in Meeting 1, making persona classification preliminary. Recommend:

- Direct engagement in next meeting
- Understand his role and responsibilities at Kixie
- Assess what level of detail he wants vs. delegation to team
- Confirm if Celine classification is accurate

# Persona Flexibility Note

**PRELIMINARY CLASSIFICATION - REQUIRES VALIDATION**

David is tentatively classified as Celine (Executive Sponsor) based on limited contextual evidence: executive authority over legal agreements, strategic oversight without tactical involvement, and delegation of partnership management to Andrew and Ben. However, this classification needs confirmation through direct interaction. He may also exhibit Odis (Sales Operations) traits if he's more operationally focused, or Aaron traits if he's more actively involved in partnership strategy.

**Action Required**: Prioritize direct engagement with David in upcoming meetings to validate persona and develop comprehensive profile.
