# Meeting History

• Meeting 1: November 6, 2025 - Discovery/alignment call discussing post-sales intelligence needs, AI automation strategy for 2026, tech stack consolidation, and competitive positioning vs Google Gemini

# Persona Validation Summary

Match Confidence: 85% match with Roger (Revenue Leader)

Secondary Traits: Shows 30% traits of Odis (Operations) due to technical depth and workflow focus

Classification Rationale: David operates at executive level with clear decision authority and strategic planning for 2026 department-wide automation (80% goal). His focus on budget allocation, vendor selection, and cross-department initiatives perfectly aligns with Roger persona. However, his technical depth (Relay.app, Intercom, Google Gemini comparisons) and hands-on evaluation approach show operational thinking typical of Odis. This makes him a sophisticated buyer needing both strategic ROI validation AND tactical implementation proof points.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

## Consistent Patterns (Single meeting - to validate)

- Challenges generic positioning and asks for concrete examples
- Articulates detailed dream state scenarios to test vendor understanding
- Evaluates alternatives actively (Google Gemini comparison)
- Time-constrained but engages deeply when value demonstrated
- Thinks in terms of team enablement not just tools

## Evolution to Track

Currently: Active evaluation mode, comparing purpose-built vs platform approaches for 2026

Trajectory: Moving toward decision on agentic AI strategy for cross-department rollout

# Aggregated Insights

## Pain Points (Frequency)

- Fragmented tech stack with no unified approach (stated explicitly)
- Time constraints preventing hands-on implementation (mentioned 2x)
- Generic vendor positioning that doesn't address specific needs (expressed frustration)
- Gap between automation vision and execution capability
- Current tools (Gong, UpdateAI, Relay.app, Zapier) are disconnected

## Goals Consistency

Primary: Automate 80% of repetitive workflows across ALL departments by 2026

Secondary: Enable CSM team with proactive daily intelligence and task automation

Emerging: Evaluate purpose-built vs platform approaches (Google Gemini vs specialized tools)

# Strategic Engagement Notes

## What Works (proven this meeting)

- Concrete use case examples (Notion ICP workflow, end-of-month deal closure prompt)
- Acknowledging when positioning is generic and pivoting to specifics
- Understanding his technical depth despite executive role
- Proposing CEO Woody involvement for technical depth conversation
- Mike's transparency about evolving understanding of the space

## What Doesn't Work

- Generic "unified platform" messaging without proof points
- Avoiding his comparison to alternatives (Google Gemini)
- Assuming he wants high-level overview vs implementation details
- Underestimating his technical knowledge

## Next Steps Committed

1. Build CSM Monday morning workflow demo as discussed
2. Include CEO Woody on next call for deeper technical discussion
3. Address Google Gemini comparison with purpose-built differentiation
4. Show examples of cross-department workflows (not just sales/CS)

# Key Quotes by Theme

## Automation Vision

"We wanna do things like, let's document all of our core workflows across the business next year that have any repetitive task, 80% of it's gonna be automated and replaced next year. Absolutely."

## CSM Enablement Dream State

"What I really want for that CSM is when they come in Monday morning, what's sitting in front of them is here's for each of these accounts. Here's the 10 things that you should go do next. By the way, I've teed up for you three of these. Just wanna make sure as a human, you wanna confirm you wanna send that email to that person, that to that person, and I'm starting to prep your QBR deck for the thing I saw on your calendar in two weeks."

## Evaluation Criteria

"Why wouldn't we just do that [Google Gemini]? Like, what how are you gonna help us? ...there's a generic, hey. We can help you build all of your we can be your, like, backbone for how you build out your agentic agents versus more purpose built."

## Current State Assessment

"We're doing a lot of good things. We're not doing anywhere close to what we should be doing... We don't have a unified tech stack and approach for it. That's for sure."

## Time Constraints

"I love all this, by the way. I can have these conversations all day. If I had more time, I just don't have more time."

## What He Values

"It's a question of, hey. There's a bunch of purpose built stuff that can help you do things, and they're valuable but not as valuable as trying to figure out that bigger thing, if that makes any sense."
