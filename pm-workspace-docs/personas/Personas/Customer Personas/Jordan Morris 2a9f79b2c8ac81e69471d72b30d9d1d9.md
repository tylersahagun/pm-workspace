Validation Notes: Limited participation in this meeting makes persona assignment tentative. Jordan was mentioned by Adam as having individual rep tabs for call tracking, suggesting SDR/AE role. Deferred to Adam throughout the call, indicating either lower authority or observational participation. Need additional meeting data to confirm persona match and gather more behavioral patterns.
Validation Status: Needs More Data

# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 12, 2025 - Observer in call scoring automation discussion

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 60% match with Aaron (AE)

**Secondary Consideration**: Could be Odis (Operations) depending on actual role

**Classification Rationale**:
Limited participation makes definitive persona assignment challenging. Jordan was referenced as one of the reps who would have individual tabs in the call scoring system, suggesting a sales/SDR role (Aaron persona). However, presence in operational planning meeting could indicate operations support role. Tentatively assigned Aaron persona but flagged for additional data collection.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Consistent Patterns** (Initial meeting):

- Minimal verbal participation
- Defers to others on agenda/direction

**Observation Note**:
This was primarily an observer role. Need more meetings where Jordan is primary participant to establish accurate behavioral patterns.

# Aggregated Insights

**Context from Meeting**:

- Mentioned as one of the reps (alongside "Gianni Justice") who will have tabs in scoring spreadsheet
- Present but not driving conversation
- No specific pain points, goals, or tools discussed by Jordan directly

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**Current Understanding**:
Insufficient data to provide strategic engagement recommendations. Need to observe Jordan in meetings where they are primary participant or stakeholder.

**Next Steps for Validation**:

- Attend meetings where Jordan is primary speaker
- Identify actual role and responsibilities
- Understand their specific pain points and goals
- Observe decision-making patterns
