Tools Mentioned: Firefly, Grain, Granola, HubSpot
Traits That Don't Match: • Not a decision maker (reports to Andrew Sorensen, Head of CS)
• Sales cycle context less relevant (focuses on post-sale)
• Less focused on pipeline/quota metrics
• Company using competitors (Grain company-wide, testing AskElephant separately)
Traits That Match: • Managing large book of business (110 agency clients)
• Extremely time-constrained with back-to-back meetings
• Values personalization in customer communications
• Struggles with sales-to-CS handoffs
• Limited prep time before customer calls
• Uses AI tools but wants human touch
• Monthly check-in cadence (aspirational)
• High volume onboarding (45 clients in Q4)
Validation Notes: Strong Celine (CSM) match. Preston is managing 110 agency clients at Scrunch (AI search solutions). Primary pain: time constraints preventing personalized customer engagement. Currently back-to-back meetings 9:30-4:30 with no prep time. Uses Grain (company standard) and Granola (personal preference) but neither provides scorecards or churn risk detection. Interested in AskElephant's capabilities but Andrew Sorensen (Head of CS) is the decision maker and already testing the platform. Company expecting significant growth (3 more CS hires in 3-4 months). Sales cycle currently short (mostly one-call close) but expecting to lengthen as they move upmarket. Preston can be a champion but needs Andrew's buy-in.
Validation Status: Strong Match

# Meeting History

- **November 13, 2025**: Discovery/ICP qualification call with Tony Mickelsen - Preston shared CS operations, pain points, and team structure

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 90% match with Celine (CSM)

**Classification Rationale**:
Preston exhibits classic CSM persona characteristics: managing a large book of business (110 clients), severe time constraints with back-to-back meetings, desire for personalized customer engagement, and challenges with sales handoffs. The high volume (45 onboardings in Q4) and lack of prep time align perfectly with Celine's pain points. However, Preston is an influencer rather than decision maker, with Andrew Sorensen (Head of CS) holding purchasing authority.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Communication Approach**:

- Casual and collaborative tone
- Transparent about challenges and limitations
- Values relationship-building over automation

# Aggregated Insights

**Pain Points (Priority Order)**:

1. **Time Management** - Back-to-back meetings with zero breaks, no prep time
2. **Personalization at Scale** - Wants human touch but managing 110 clients
3. **Manual Work** - Spending after-hours on personalized follow-ups
4. **Handoff Context** - Limited information from sales in HubSpot
5. **Lack of Structure** - "Wild West" environment, building playbooks

**Goals Consistency**:

- Primary: Maintain personal touch with customers despite volume
- Secondary: Reduce time spent on manual administrative work
- Emerging: Build scalable CS operations as team grows

**Tools Ecosystem**:

- HubSpot (CRM) - company standard
- Grain (notetaker) - company standard for sales
- Granola (notetaker) - personal choice for better AI research
- AskElephant - Head of CS testing independently

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**Buying Committee**:

- **Decision Maker**: Andrew Sorensen (Head of CS) - already testing AskElephant
- **Influencer**: Preston Melle (this contact) - can champion internally
- **Context**: Andrew has connection to AskElephant's Head of CS

**Timing Considerations**:

- Currently at low end of ICP (5 CS team members, growing to 8)
- Sales cycle currently short but expected to lengthen
- Company in hypergrowth phase (3-6 months will look very different)
- Best timing: Likely 3-6 months as pain points become more acute

**What Works**:

- Discussing personalization vs. automation trade-offs
- Focusing on time savings and prep quality
- Emphasizing churn risk and proactive engagement
- Connecting with multiple stakeholders

**Competitive Context**:

- Using Grain company-wide
- Preston prefers Granola for AI research capabilities
- Neither tool provides scorecards or churn risk detection
- Gap opportunity: Validation/coaching features

**Key Differentiators to Emphasize**:

- Call scoring and CS methodology coaching
- Churn risk detection and proactive alerts
- Pre-populated personalized emails (not generic AI summaries)
- Better context transfer from sales to CS
- Aggregate analysis across book of business

# Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Connect with Andrew Sorensen (already testing platform)
2. **Short-term**: Stay in touch with Preston as internal champion
3. **Long-term**: Re-engage in 3-6 months as team scales and pain intensifies

**Follow-up Strategy**:

- Reference Andrew Sorensen connection in outreach
- Position as complement to (not replacement for) current tools
- Focus on features neither Grain nor Granola provide
- Align timing with team expansion and process formalization
