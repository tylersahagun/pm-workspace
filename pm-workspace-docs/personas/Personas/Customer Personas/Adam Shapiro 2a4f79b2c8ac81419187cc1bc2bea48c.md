Tools Mentioned: Google Sheets, HubSpot, Salesforce, Slack, Zapier
Traits That Don't Match: • Not pure C-level - reports to CEO, not sole decision maker
• More hands-on/tactical than typical Roger persona
• Technical implementation focus beyond strategic oversight
• Individual contributor mindset alongside leadership influence
Traits That Match: • ROI-driven decision making - immediately calculates cost-to-value
• Strategic rollout planning - start with AE team, expand to CS
• Workflow optimization focus - excited about AI workflow builder
• Cross-functional coordination - works with Brett and CEO Puya
• Scalability concerns - mentions time consumption and team growth
• Technical evaluation depth - asks specific integration questions
• Self-sufficiency preference - wants tools to reduce support dependency
Validation Notes: Adam is a RevOps/Operations lead at Intaker championing AskElephant adoption for 7-8 users (5-6 AEs plus himself and Sales Director Brett). Needs CEO Puya approval by Tuesday 11/12. Currently using Cloze CRM (renewed), Fireflies (replacing). Pivoting from complex SDR/Voci integration to simpler AE note-taking use case. Very excited about AI workflow builder and signals features for self-sufficiency. ROI-focused: 'what do we have to make for this to make sense if we get another $100 per person?'
Validation Status: Strong Match (80-100%)
