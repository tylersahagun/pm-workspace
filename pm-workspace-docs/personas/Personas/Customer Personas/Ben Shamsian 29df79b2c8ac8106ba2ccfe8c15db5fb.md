Tools Mentioned: Fireflies
Validation Notes: Follow-up Demo (11/13): Scott was on major deal and couldn't attend, but Spencer represented his interests well. Scott managing 26 people across 5 sales teams (SMB, mid-market, enterprise, channel, SEs). Actively evaluating Fireflies same day, indicating serious competitive evaluation mode. Has executive sponsorship through Jaren (COO) who has relationship with AskElephant CEO. Timeline pressure: wants decision by end of year for January SKO rollout. All signs point to typical Roger evaluation pattern: methodical comparison, executive-level relationships influencing deal, focused on organizational impact at scale. Maintains 90% confidence - textbook Roger behavior in buying cycle.

# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: October 31, 2025 - Weekly Partner Sync, first half focused on AI education (prompting, orchestration, context windows), second half observing partnership strategy discussion

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Roger (Technical Implementation Leader)

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Strong Roger indicators - hands-on technical work, actively learning and implementing AI prompting, validates technical implementations, programming background

**Why this classification**:
Ben exhibits classic Roger traits: he's directly hands-on with technical implementation ("I'm actually trying to fix it myself"), actively learning new technical concepts (AI prompting, orchestration, markdown), validates his own work ("I validated this. They're coming in. Correct data is being set."), has programming background, and leads technical aspects while wanting to stay involved in training sessions. His engagement during Josh's AI education session showed genuine technical curiosity and immediate application - he successfully debugged and fixed the signal integration during the meeting.

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns Across Meetings:**

- Hands-on technical approach: Prefers to learn by doing and fix things himself
- Continuous learner: Actively working on AI concepts "outside here too"
- Validation-focused: Tests implementations to ensure correct data flow
- Team collaboration: Wants to be included in training sessions to help support sales and CS teams
- Quality-oriented: Doesn't consider something done until he's validated it works

**Communication Preferences:**

- Technical and precise language
- Appreciates structured education (responded well to Josh's frameworks)
- Brief communicator - gets to the point
- Collaborative but independent: "while then he can double check" (wants to solve it first, then validate with team)
- Working from home when doing deep technical work

# Strategic Engagement Playbook

**Current Stage**: Technical Partner - Learning & Implementation Phase

**What We've Learned Works:**

- Technical education: Ben deeply engaged with AI fundamentals (prompting, orchestration, context windows, markdown)
- Hands-on learning: Give him the tools and let him figure it out, then validate together
- Clear examples: Josh's "no shot, one shot, few shot" explanation with concrete examples resonated
- Real-world application: Learned concepts and immediately applied them to fix the signal integration
- Being included: Wants to be added to training meetings for Hema and sales team

**What to Avoid:**

- Taking over his technical work - he wants to learn and solve it himself
- Skipping the "why" - he wants to understand the underlying principles
- Overwhelming with too many initiatives at once (agrees with Andrew's point about keeping things separate)

**Current Priorities:**

1. Learning AI prompting and orchestration deeply
2. Implementing and validating Kixie-AskElephant integrations
3. Supporting sales and customer support teams with technical knowledge
4. Building competency in agentic AI systems

# Key Quotes

**On Learning Approach**:
"I'm actually trying to fix it myself. That's okay with you because... So while then he can double check."
Context: Shows independent problem-solving mindset but values collaboration for validation

**On Technical Validation**:
"I validated this. They're coming in. Correct data is being set. They're being fired."
Context: Methodical approach to confirming implementations work correctly

**On Appreciation for Education**:
"Thank you very much. I really liked the conversation today, Joshua. Thank you very much for the informative."
Context: Genuine appreciation for learning opportunities - education is valuable to him

**On Technical Concepts**:
"Markdown is a notation that you can basically highlight your text to have bullets and bolds and all that stuff."
Context: Clear technical explainer, good at breaking down concepts

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions/Blockers:**

- Works closely with: Andrew Claus (partnership lead), Tyler (mentioned as colleague working on technical issues)
- Reports to/coordinates with: David Gable (likely), Hema (head of customer support)
- Collaborates with: Kevin Portillo (sales operations)
- External partners: Josh Daniels and Pete Belliston at AskElephant (good technical rapport developing)

**Decision Dynamics:**

- Authority level: High technical authority, likely needs approval for strategic/budget decisions
- Key influencers: Can influence technical architecture and implementation approach
- Implementation control: Direct - he's the one building and validating

**Team Dynamics:**

- Head of technical integration/implementation
- Wants to support customer-facing teams (sales, CS) with training
- Independent worker who values collaboration
- Comfortable asking questions and admitting when he doesn't know something ("I have not heard that before")

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on Meeting 1:**

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Continue including Ben in technical training sessions with Kixie sales/CS teams
2. **SHORT-TERM**: Provide additional AI prompting resources and examples for Ben to experiment with
3. **ONGOING**:
    - Let Ben lead technical implementation with Tyler
    - Provide educational content on agentic orchestration
    - Include in architecture discussions for joint use cases
4. **VALIDATION**: Schedule technical validation sessions after implementations

**Engagement Strategy:**

- Lead with education and "why" behind technical approaches
- Give him autonomy to implement with support available
- Include in training sessions (he specifically requested to be added)
- Provide concrete examples and frameworks (works well for his learning style)
- Regular technical validation check-ins
- Share advanced AI concepts and resources - he's hungry to learn

**Watch for:**

- Opportunity: Ben is building deep AI competency - could become internal AI champion at Kixie
- Opportunity: His desire to train sales/CS teams means he's thinking about scalability
- Success Indicator: He fixed the signal integration during the meeting - high technical capability
- Risk: Bandwidth concerns - he's working on "so many other pieces" per Andrew
- Engagement Signal: Wants to be included in meetings even when busy - high commitment level

# Persona Flexibility Note

Ben is a textbook Roger with no significant secondary persona traits. He's technically focused, hands-on, validation-oriented, and approaches problems with a learning mindset. His leadership appears to be through technical excellence and enablement rather than people management or strategic planning. When engaging with Ben, lead with technical depth, give him autonomy, and provide learning opportunities.
