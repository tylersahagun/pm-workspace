# Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: 2025-11-11 - Discovery call with Tony (Marketing) and James (Sales/AE). Discussed Vector Defense's need for conversational intelligence, knowledge management, and workflow automation to support distributed team coordination and product development feedback aggregation.

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 75% match with Odis (Operations)

**Secondary Traits**: Shows 40% traits of Product Manager (not in standard personas)

**Classification Rationale**:

Caleb strongly aligns with the Odis persona based on his operational focus on team coordination, knowledge management, and process efficiency. As Director of Product at a startup, he's responsible for aggregating inputs from multiple distributed sources (international teams, battlefield observations, customer feedback, expert pilots) and making them actionable. His primary pain points revolve around information silos, remote team coordination, and manual aggregation work - all classic Odis challenges.

However, he also shows significant product management traits not fully captured in the standard personas, particularly around product development decision-making and technical requirements (PCB development, drone systems). The defense/hardware context adds unique complexity.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Initial Meeting Patterns**:

- Technical and detailed communication style - provides extensive context
- Highly collaborative, open to education and partnership
- Cost-conscious and compliance-aware
- Multi-tasking across many partnerships/relationships
- Seeks automation to avoid being "left behind"

**Decision-Making Style**:

- Compliance requirements are non-negotiable (CMMC)
- Willing to explore solutions but needs clear value proposition
- Interested in differentiators vs. competitors
- Forward-thinking about AI adoption necessity

# Aggregated Insights

**Pain Points (Frequency)**:

1. **Knowledge management** - aggregating insights from multiple sources (battlefield, customers, experts)
2. **Remote team coordination** - sharing information across distributed teams in multiple countries
3. **Rolodex/relationship management** - finding past contacts relevant to current problems
4. **Manual work** - repetitive tasks like government contract responses
5. **Project management complexity** - tracking product development across teams

# Primary Goals

1. Adopt AI tools to maintain competitive advantage
2. Improve team efficiency and information sharing
3. Automate repetitive workflows (contract responses, task creation)
4. Better aggregate and action customer/field feedback
5. Scale operations without proportional headcount growth

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**What Works** (early indicators):

- Being upfront about limitations (SCIF environments, video analysis)
- Understanding the unique defense/hardware context
- Offering education and partnership (Tony's neighbor offer)
- Demonstrating workflow flexibility and customization
- Emphasizing service-oriented implementation support

**Potential Challenges**:

- CMMC compliance is make-or-break requirement
- Must prove ROI justifies $50K+/month investment
- Competing with free tools (ChatGPT, Grok) for some use cases
- Need to integrate with Monday.com (on roadmap but not ready)

**Key Stakeholders**:

- Caleb (Director of Product) - Decision Maker
- Remote team members across US, Taiwan, Israel, Japan
- Training/operator team (tier 1/2 operators)
- Engineering team (previous director used Jira)

# Next Steps

- Follow-up meeting scheduled for next week (week of Nov 18, 2025)
- Tony/team investigating CMMC compliance feasibility and cost
- Need to prepare use case examples for workflow automation
- Consider Monday.com integration timeline importance
