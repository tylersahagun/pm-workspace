Last Analysis Date: November 12, 2025
Match Confidence: 8500%
Matched Persona: Odis (Operations)
New Traits Discovered: Strong familiarity with competitive tools (Attention has built workflows before); Prefers vendors who build solutions for them vs self-service; Values searchable/filterable workflows; Needs to balance tool implementation with not distracting revenue team; Works closely with Austin (sales leader who brought SPICE methodology); Coordinates with Scott Thomas (VP Customer Experience); Product team members: Chris Blake or Eric (head of product); Engineering contact: Chantel (HubSpot specialist)
Observed Goals: Automate sales-to-CS handoffs, Go deeper on current skeleton workflows, Implement automated coaching for reps, Pull product insights from customer conversations, Refine existing system into well refined machine, Track sentiment analysis for customer health scoring, Understand win/loss reasons with detailed analysis
Observed Pain Points: Cannot search workflows in current platform, Manual workflow creation and management, Multiple disconnected workflow builders in current tool, Platform adoption challenges, Rep attention management during end-of-month push, Self-led/self-guided setup requiring significant internal effort, Timing issues with CRM field updates
Persona: Odis (https://www.notion.so/Odis-27ff79b2c8ac8056b9ece0a780fbd900?pvs=21)

Tools Mentioned: Attention, EOS/90, HubSpot, Jira, Monday, Slack
Traits That Don't Match: Less customer-facing than typical Operations role (acknowledged probably not right person to test coaching features); Currently overextended wearing three hats; More implementation-focused than strategic in this context
Traits That Match: Highly technical and process-oriented; Manages cross-functional operations (Sales CS Product feedback); Builds and optimizes workflows and automations; Uses MEDDPIC + SPICE qualification frameworks; Focused on data quality and CRM hygiene; Implements sentiment analysis and health scoring; Coordinates between multiple teams (AEs CSMs SDRs Product); Values efficiency and systematic approaches
Validation Notes: Connor is clearly an Operations/RevOps professional managing the entire revenue tech stack and workflow automation for SalesAI. He's implemented sophisticated workflows including: MEDDPIC+SPICE scoring automated coaching via Slack sentiment analysis for CS team sales-to-CS handoffs and product feedback loops. Currently using Attention but frustrated with lack of search functionality and slow self-service implementation. Looking to migrate to AskElephant for deeper customization and white-glove service. Not the end user of coaching features but the architect of the systems.
Validation Status: High Confidence

# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 12 2025 - Partner evaluation call with AskElephant to replace Attention as conversation intelligence platform

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 85% match with Odis (Operations)
**Secondary Traits**: Shows 15% traits of Irina (Implementation) due to hands-on technical setup work

**Classification Rationale**:
Connor exhibits strong Operations persona characteristics: he owns the entire revenue operations workflow architecture implements complex automation across Sales and CS teams manages CRM data quality coordinates cross-functional processes and evaluates/implements revenue tools. His focus on MEDDPIC+SPICE frameworks automated coaching systems sentiment analysis and systematic handoffs all align with Operations leadership. While he's currently doing implementation work (showing Irina traits) his strategic oversight of the entire revenue process makes him primarily an Odis persona.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Consistent Patterns** (from this meeting):

- Leads with technical requirements and existing workflow details
- Asks clarifying questions about capabilities before committing
- Thinks systematically about cross-functional impact
- Prefers vendors who do implementation work for them vs self-service
- Protective of revenue team's focus during critical periods

**Current State**:

- Overextended managing multiple operational areas simultaneously
- Frustrated with current tool's limitations (especially workflow search)
- Ready to migrate but cautious about timing and team distraction
- Values white-glove service over self-service implementation

# Aggregated Insights

**Pain Points**:

- Workflow management complexity (cannot search/organize workflows)
- Slow adoption due to self-guided implementation model
- Multiple disconnected workflow builders in current platform
- Manual email generation for reps
- CRM update timing issues
- Balancing tool implementation with revenue team focus

**Goals**:

- Primary: Create very well refined machine for revenue operations
- Secondary: Go deeper on existing workflow skeleton
- Automation: Sales coaching CS handoffs sentiment tracking product feedback
- Analytics: Win/loss analysis rep performance comparison customer health scoring

**Technical Requirements**:

- Ability to search and filter workflows
- MEDDPIC + SPICE qualification scoring
- Multi-channel automation (HubSpot Slack Jira)
- Daily and weekly coaching summaries
- Sentiment analysis with 1-5 scoring
- Product feedback routing to engineering

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**What Works**:

- Showing specific workflow replication capability
- Offering to build workflows for them (white-glove service)
- Demonstrating superior search/filter capabilities
- Respecting timing concerns around end-of-month priorities
- Including multiple stakeholders (AE CSM SDR) in testing

**What Doesn't**:

- Self-service implementation approaches
- Pushing for immediate adoption during busy periods
- Focusing solely on end-user features vs operational capabilities

**Recommended Approach**:

- Position as operational upgrade not just feature swap
- Emphasize implementation team doing the heavy lifting
- Schedule around revenue team's calendar
- Focus on going deeper vs starting over
- Highlight superior workflow organization and search
