# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Roger (Revenue) with Aaron (Account Executive) traits

**Why this classification**:
Tanner exhibits strong Roger (Revenue) characteristics as his primary persona. He's deeply connected in the Utah tech ecosystem and actively focuses on creating revenue opportunities for AskElephant through his extensive network. His approach is strategic and relationship-driven, understanding exactly who makes purchasing decisions at various companies (Trevor at Nectar, Graham and Alan at Connect).

He also displays Aaron (AE) traits from his sales background. He thinks like a seller, understands pricing sensitivities, and knows how to navigate the sales process effectively. His comment about not wanting to "screw you guys over" on pricing discussions shows his awareness of deal dynamics and negotiation considerations.
