Validation Notes: Kara is in an operations/finance role with direct budget oversight. She's frustrated by lack of visibility into licensing and spends significant time manually tracking costs. She's a decision maker alongside Randy for tool investments. Primary concerns: cost control, administrative efficiency, and clear reporting. Strong match to Odis persona with additional finance/accounting overlay.
