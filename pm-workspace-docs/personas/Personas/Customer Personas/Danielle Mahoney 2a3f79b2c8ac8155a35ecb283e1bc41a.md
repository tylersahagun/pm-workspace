Tools Mentioned: Jira, Notion, Planhat, Salesforce, Slack
Traits That Don't Match: • Works in unique rev-share model (pays clients monthly) vs traditional SaaS
• Has employer sales teams under her purview (hybrid revenue responsibility)
• CSMs are revenue-accountable when job board performance dips
• More operational complexity than typical CSM role
Traits That Match: • Oversees post-sale customer journey (implementation, CSM, support)
• Manages multiple tools and seeks integration/consolidation
• Focused on team efficiency and scaling operations
• Needs better visibility into customer health metrics
• Struggles with manual reporting and data aggregation
• Responsible for customer outcomes tied to revenue
• Collaborative communication style, seeks partnerships
Validation Notes: Strong match with Celine (CSM) persona. Danielle oversees post-sale operations including implementation, CSM, and support teams for Web Scribble, an HR tech company that creates job boards for nonprofits via rev-share model. Currently in middle of complex Planhat implementation (18 months, migrating platforms). Primary challenges: data fragmentation across multiple systems, creating executive summaries for client VPs, scaling team without additional headcount, and managing white-glove service expectations despite resource constraints.
Validation Status: ✅ Strong Match (80-100%)

# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 6, 2025 - Initial discovery call with Mike Canova. Discussed company model, team structure, current tech stack challenges, and Planhat implementation struggles.

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 85% match with Celine (CSM)
**Secondary Traits**: Shows 30% traits of Odis (Operations) due to operational oversight scope

**Classification Rationale**:
Danielle exhibits strong alignment with the Celine (CSM) persona through her post-sale ownership, focus on customer health/outcomes, tool consolidation needs, and scaling challenges. Her role encompasses implementation, CSM, and support teams - all core CSM functions. The revenue accountability tied to CSM performance and data fragmentation pain points are classic CSM challenges. However, she also demonstrates operational leadership characteristics (managing multiple teams, process redesign, platform implementations) that add complexity beyond typical CSM scope.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Consistent Patterns** (1 meeting - baseline):

- Transparent about challenges and constraints
- Seeks practical solutions before committing
- Values seeing proof/demos before decisions
- Cautious about adding tools during active implementations
- Focused on team enablement over personal productivity

**Initial Assessment**:
Danielle is methodical and risk-aware. She explicitly stated need to complete Planhat implementation before evaluating new tools, showing disciplined approach to change management. She's also delegating upward (putting executive summary burden back on CEO), indicating she's comfortable setting boundaries and managing expectations.

# Aggregated Insights

**Pain Points** (by severity):

1. Data fragmentation across multiple systems (Salesforce, Planhat, Notion, Jira, custom internal systems, job board analytics) - CRITICAL
2. Manual executive summary creation for client VPs - HIGH
3. Planhat implementation challenges (18 months, platform migration, data accuracy issues) - HIGH
4. Scaling team without additional headcount - HIGH
5. White-glove service expectations across customer tiers - MEDIUM
6. Team trust in Planhat data due to historical inaccuracy - MEDIUM
7. Self-onboarding complexity for customers - MEDIUM

**Goals Consistency**:

- Primary: Successfully implement Planhat and establish it as single source of truth
- Secondary: Automate executive reporting and data aggregation
- Tertiary: Scale operations efficiently without hiring
- Emerging: Build internal knowledge base in Notion for team enablement

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**What Works** (proven in this meeting):

- Consultative, non-pushy discovery approach
- Acknowledging timing constraints (Planhat completion first)
- Offering specific use cases relevant to her pain points
- Transparency about product capabilities and limitations
- Scheduling follow-up after she has more clarity on current tools

**What Doesn't** (learned from experience):

- Pushing for immediate demos or decisions
- Ignoring the Planhat implementation timeline
- Positioning as Planhat replacement vs. complement

**Buying Timeline**:
Extended - likely Q1 2026 or later. Must complete Planhat implementation and evaluate its full capabilities before considering additional tools. Budget discussions for next year, but new tool adoption on hold.

**Decision-Making Authority**:
Influencer/Champion - Has authority over post-sale operations and can drive tool evaluation, but likely needs CEO approval for new platform investments given mention of "they're gonna look at me like I have 85 heads" if she proposed new tool during Planhat implementation.
