• Interested in partial adoption: Considering 'smaller part of the team' vs full rollout

Tools Mentioned: AskElephant, HubSpot, Slack
Traits That Don't Match: • Not a paying CSM managing customers (trial user evaluating for own team)
• Less focused on customer outcomes, more on internal team adoption
• Not yet in renewal/expansion mode - still in trial/decision phase
• Shows more implementation/evaluation traits than CSM management traits
Traits That Match: • Trial customer evaluating platform value
• Concerned about adoption challenges within team
• Curious and engaged, asking detailed questions about features
• Hands-on testing and exploration mindset
• Focused on understanding practical workflows and outputs
• Collaborative communication style
• Open about challenges: 'adoption of the tool at x five is not the greatest'
Validation Notes: Maciej is evaluating AskElephant during a trial period (expires Nov 14) for X Five. Primary behavior shows trial evaluator/decision maker characteristics rather than traditional CSM persona. Key concerns: team adoption challenges, understanding platform capabilities, and determining if partial adoption is viable. Shows high engagement and technical curiosity during onboarding walkthrough, asking detailed questions about workflows, integrations (HubSpot/Slack), and output locations. Decision authority is clear - discussing with team on Wednesday to determine continuation. Match with Celine (CSM) is partial because while he's exploring customer-facing workflows, his immediate focus is internal evaluation rather than customer management. May shift to stronger CSM match if they proceed past trial.
Validation Status: ⚠️ Partial Match (60-79%)

# Meeting History

**Meeting 1: November 10, 2025 - AskElephant Onboarding Session**

- Context: Product walkthrough and adoption consultation
- Duration: ~34 minutes
- Focus: Understanding workflows, integrations, and addressing adoption challenges

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 75% match with Celine (CSM)

**Secondary Traits**: Shows 40% traits of Irina (Implementation) due to trial evaluation focus

**Classification Rationale**:

Maciej exhibits strong curiosity about customer-facing workflows (churn alerts, deal interventions, sales-to-CS handoffs) which aligns with CSM concerns. However, his current context is trial evaluation rather than active customer management. He's methodically exploring how AskElephant can solve internal adoption challenges at X Five. The 75% match reflects his strategic interest in CSM-relevant features while acknowledging his immediate role as internal evaluator/decision maker.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Consistent Patterns** (Initial Meeting):

- **Methodical explorer**: Asks clarifying questions before moving forward ("where would I find them?", "how do I add an app?")
- **Transparency-first**: Openly shares challenges rather than masking issues
- **Hands-on learner**: Prefers live walkthrough and testing vs documentation
- **Integration-focused**: Immediately connected HubSpot and Slack before meeting

**Initial Positioning**:

- Starting point: Technical curiosity with adoption concerns
- Current state: Engaged but uncertain about team buy-in
- Trajectory: Decision point approaching (trial expires Nov 14)

# Aggregated Insights

**Pain Points (Frequency)**:

- Low team adoption (mentioned 3 times) - PRIMARY CONCERN
- Unclear value demonstration to team members (mentioned 2 times)
- Understanding where to find workflow outputs (mentioned 2 times)
- Trial timeline pressure (mentioned 1 time)

**Goals Consistency**:

- Primary: Determine if AskElephant fits X Five's needs
- Secondary: Understand practical workflow applications
- Emerging: Explore partial team adoption as compromise solution

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**What Works** (proven in this meeting):

- Screen-sharing product walkthroughs with step-by-step guidance
- Addressing adoption concerns directly and offering solutions (training calls, trial extensions)
- Live testing and troubleshooting (workflow fixes, channel setups)
- Acknowledging challenges rather than overselling

**What to Watch**:

- Decision deadline: Team discussion Wednesday, trial expires Nov 14
- Resistance factor: Some team members "not really wanting" to use it
- Compromise scenario: Considering smaller team deployment vs full adoption

**Recommended Next Steps**:

1. Offer trial extension to reduce pressure (Parker already offered)
2. Provide team training call to address resistance
3. Build case for partial adoption with specific use cases
4. Follow up Monday after team decision discussion
