# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: 2025-11-03 - Initial onboarding and product demo

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Celine (Customer Success Manager) with Odis (Operations) traits

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Presents as Celine-type - client-facing role in recruiting with strong focus on candidate relationships, interview consistency, and team handoffs. Shows additional Odis characteristics in her interest in workflow automation and process optimization.

**Why this classification**:
Krystal operates in a relationship-driven recruiting environment where she manages multiple candidate touchpoints (similar to CSM managing customer journey). Her primary concerns center on ensuring no candidate context is lost between interviews, maintaining consistency in evaluation, and enabling smooth handoffs to colleagues like Zan. These are core Celine traits - protecting relationships through process excellence.

However, she demonstrates notable Odis tendencies: immediate interest in building custom workflows (daily recap automation), understanding of integration needs (calendar, email, Notion), and focus on eliminating manual work for her entire team. She thinks systematically about how information flows through her recruiting process.

**Key Quote**: "All of the different interviews, like, if someone was doing an interview and then passing it to Zan or to you, vice versa. Yeah. It gives you that recap, and you can compare. Like, you ask the same questions. What were the answers? Why did they differ?"

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns Across Meetings:**

- **Relationship-first mindset**: Immediately focused on how AskElephant helps maintain candidate/client context across team touchpoints
- **Collaboration-oriented**: Frequently references working with Zan and team members, thinks in "we" terms
- **Quick technical adopter**: Grasped product features rapidly, asked clarifying questions, engaged with demo
- **Process-conscious**: Interested in comparing interview responses, standardizing questions, ensuring consistency
- **Practical problem-solver**: Wants solutions that fit into daily workflow (5PM Central recap timing)

**Communication Preferences (learned over time):**

- **Timezone**: Central Standard Time (CST) - based in Utah but operates on CST schedule
- **Preferred follow-up**: Email (asked Pete to text her the email address for package delivery)
- **Learning style**: Hands-on during demo, follows along with screen sharing
- **Meeting engagement**: Active participant, asks questions as they arise, comfortable with tech

# Strategic Engagement Playbook (Updated)

**Current Stage**: New Customer - Just completed onboarding

**What We've Learned Works:**

- **Show, don't tell**: Pete's hands-on demo approach worked well - Krystal engaged more when seeing actual workflows
- **Use case specific examples**: When Pete explained interview comparison use cases, Krystal immediately connected to her needs
- **Workflow customization**: Building the daily recap workflow live demonstrated value immediately
- **Integration mention**: Brief mention of Notion integration sparked interest - they use Notion extensively

**What to Avoid (learned from experience):**

- Don't overwhelm with features - Krystal appreciated focused demo on core use cases
- Avoid generic examples - recruiting-specific scenarios resonated much better

**Evolving Priorities:**

1. **Meeting 1 Priority**:
    - Get basic meeting capture and recaps working
    - Build daily team update workflow (5PM CST recap to Zan)
    - Understand interview comparison capabilities

# Key Quotes Across All Meetings

**Meeting 1**:
"All of the different interviews, like, if someone was doing an interview and then passing it to Zan or to you, vice versa. Yeah. It gives you that recap, and you can compare. Like, you ask the same questions. What were the answers? Why did they differ?"

**Context**: This quote reveals Krystal's core pain point - maintaining consistency and context across multiple recruiter touchpoints with the same candidate. She's looking for a system of record that enables quality control and reduces "lost in translation" moments.

**Meeting 1**:
"In query stuff in Notion, build projects inside of Notion, do all that stuff."

**Context**: Indicates Confetti Recruiting is already using Notion as a central hub. Future integration opportunity to create even more seamless workflow.

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions/Blockers:**

- **Primary user**: Krystal
- **Key stakeholder**: Zan (appears to be partner/manager she reports to or works closely with)
- **Team size**: Small recruiting team (mentioned "Trenton Confetti" in account, likely family-run or partnership)

**Decision Dynamics:**

- **Authority level**: Appears to have autonomy to adopt tools, but consulted Zan ("SAN's been using it a little bit")
- **Budget control**: Unclear, but Pete is sending "package" (pricing) after call
- **Adoption pattern**: Willing to experiment with new tools, technically savvy enough to onboard quickly

**Use Case Specifics:**

- **Primary use**: Candidate interview tracking and team collaboration
- **Secondary use**: Daily team syncs and handoff documentation
- **Integration needs**: Calendar (already connected), Email, Notion (mentioned as existing tool)
- **Workflow automation**: Daily recap at 5PM CST with 3 bullet points per meeting

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on aggregate learnings:**

1. **Send pricing package** (Pete committed to this) - follow up within 24 hours
2. **Fix workflow issue** Pete mentioned during demo - ensure daily recap workflow is functioning properly
3. **Provide recruiting-specific templates**: Create interview comparison template, candidate tracking workflow examples
4. **Explore Notion integration**: Since they're heavy Notion users, demonstrate how AskElephant can push data to Notion databases
5. **Schedule follow-up check-in**: 1 week after onboarding to ensure she's getting value from basic features
6. **Introduce personality assessment features**: Pete mentioned LinkedIn-based personality tests during call - this sparked interest

**Watch for:**

- **Adoption velocity**: If Krystal and Zan don't start using regularly within first week, they likely won't see value
- **Workflow complexity**: The daily recap workflow had issues during demo - if automation doesn't work reliably, this could become friction point
- **Team expansion needs**: As recruiting firm, they may need to add more users if initial adoption goes well
- **Competitive recruiting environment**: Mentioned "with the network screen, way they are" - seems like they're in competitive market and need efficiency edge

**Expansion Opportunities:**

- Additional seats for recruiting team members
- Advanced workflow automation for client updates
- Integration package if Notion integration becomes critical
- Personality assessment/candidate profiling features

# Persona Flexibility Note

Krystal exhibits **Celine (CSM)** as her dominant persona - she's relationship-driven, focused on candidate experience, and concerned with handoff quality. However, she shows **Odis (Operations)** traits when discussing workflow automation, process standardization, and team efficiency.

**Recommended approach**: Lead with relationship/quality benefits (no lost candidate context, better interview consistency, stronger team collaboration) but be ready to dive into automation capabilities and technical integration details when she asks. She appreciates both the "why it matters for candidates" and the "how it makes our team more efficient" angles.

**Engagement style**: Collaborative problem-solving rather than prescriptive selling. She's a partner in figuring out the right workflow, not just a passive buyer.
