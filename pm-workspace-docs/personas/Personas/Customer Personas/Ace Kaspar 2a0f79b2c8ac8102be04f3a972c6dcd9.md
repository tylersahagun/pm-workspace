# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 3, 2025 - LinkedIn outreach coaching session / tactical knowledge exchange

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Odis (The Tactical Executor) with secondary Aaron (Analytical Skeptic) traits

**Initial Classification**:
Ace presents as a textbook Odis - obsessed with execution, results-driven, and hungry for tactical playbooks that actually work. He's a full-cycle SMB AE at HubSpot who sources 90% of his pipeline through cold calling because "that's what works for me."

**Why this classification**:

- **Execution-first mindset**: Immediately asks "Did you get quota last month?" - wants to validate tactics with results
- **Tactical learner**: "I need to go join you guys for like two months just to learn LinkedIn" - seeks apprenticeship-style learning
- **Process documentation**: Maintains personal Excel tracker despite working at HubSpot, has systematized email creation three ways
- **Testing methodology**: Plans to test experimental outreach on non-tier-1 accounts before deploying to priority targets
- **Skeptical of fluff**: Dismissed LinkedIn gurus claiming to send 50 customized emails daily as unrealistic
- **Peer-to-peer preference**: Scheduled this call specifically to extract tactical advice from a peer who's succeeding

**Aaron traits observed**:

- Questions the math: "You need 16 deals to hit quota" - always calculating
- Needs proof: Asked for Mike's quota attainment percentage and channel breakdown
- Skeptical of claims: Challenged the feasibility of daily customized email volume

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Core Patterns:**

- **Cold calling is his superpower**: 90% of pipeline comes from calls, gets more pickups than anyone else
- **Email struggles**: Sent 1,000 emails, zero meetings booked (compared to colleague who got 9 meetings from same volume)
- **LinkedIn knowledge gap**: Openly admits this is his weak channel, actively seeking to improve
- **Authenticity over polish**: Uses profanity comfortably, values genuine connections over corporate personas
- **Gaming background**: Played Halo professionally, thousands of hours invested - shows dedication and competitive nature
- **Cultural values**: Left PinDrop after being told he couldn't post on LinkedIn - autonomy and expression matter deeply

**Work Style:**

- Full-cycle selling at HubSpot SMB (1-25 employees, expanding to 1-50)
- OTE $150k, consistently exceeds quota ("way over quota last month")
- Long onboarding ramp (10 months total, 6-7 months to full ramp)
- Average deal size: $300-400, needs 16+ deals monthly to hit$ 6,700 quota
- Uses personal Excel tracker for deal visibility despite CRM availability

**Communication Preferences:**

- Casual, authentic rapport-building (bonded over gaming headsets and Halo)
- Direct questions, no fluff
- Values tactical specifics over high-level strategy
- Appreciates peer exchanges vs. formal training
- Takes notes actively during tactical discussions

# Strategic Engagement Playbook

**Current Stage**: Prospect/Peer Learner

**What Works:**

- **Tactical deep-dives**: Share specific playbooks, scripts, frameworks
- **Show your work**: Lead with results ("I hit 115% of quota"), then explain methodology
- **Peer-to-peer positioning**: Fellow seller helping fellow seller, not consultant-to-client
- **Gaming/sports analogies**: Competitive mindset resonates
- **Authenticity**: He responds to genuine, unpolished communication

**What to Avoid:**

- High-level theory without tactical application
- Corporate-speak or fake enthusiasm
- Unproven tactics from "LinkedIn gurus"
- Unrealistic volume expectations (e.g., 50 customized emails/day)
- Pitch-slapping - he's allergic to inauthenticity

**Current Priorities:**

1. **Master LinkedIn outreach**: His weakest channel, knows he's leaving pipeline on the table
2. **Improve email effectiveness**: Currently 0% conversion, frustrated by gap vs. peers
3. **Scale what works**: Already crushing it on calls, wants to add channels without sacrificing core strength
4. **Build sustainable process**: November quota pressure top-of-mind, needs pipeline for month-end grind

**Engagement Strategy:**

- Position AskElephant as tactical enablement tool for capturing/scaling what already works
- Show how conversation intelligence can help him bottle his cold calling magic
- Demonstrate LinkedIn integration for coaching/improvement on weak channel
- Focus on ROI: "You're already hitting quota - imagine if you added 20% from LinkedIn"

# Key Quotes from Meeting

"**Cold calls mainly. 90%. That's how it's always worked for me.**"

"**Emails, like, I did email campaign, bunch of them. Like, I sent like a thousand emails. I got zero booked meetings.**"

- Deal-breaker: needs autonomy and trust from leadership

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Immediate Actions:**

1. **Follow up with LinkedIn tactic**: Mike promised to tag Ace in example outreach, deliver on this
2. **Share cold calling comparison**: Ace wanted to do joint calling session - schedule this
3. **AskElephant product demo**: Frame as "capture your cold calling secrets" + "level up your LinkedIn"

**Medium-term Strategy:**

1. **Case study opportunity**: Track Ace's LinkedIn improvement journey with AskElephant coaching
2. **HubSpot expansion**: Ace could be internal champion to 400 SMB AE peers
3. **Content collaboration**: His authentic style would make excellent LinkedIn content

**Watch For:**

- **November quota pressure**: Next two weeks critical, he's starting month at zero pipeline
- **LinkedIn experimentation**: Will test Mike's tactics - follow up on results
- **Peer validation**: If James (Mike's colleague) continues crushing it, Ace will pay attention
- **Cultural fit assessment**: Ace is evaluating whether AskElephant culture matches his values

**Pricing Considerations:**

- HubSpot likely has enterprise agreement already
- Ace has individual seat budget influence
- ROI pitch: "Turn your 90% cold call channel into 70% calls + 20% LinkedIn + 10% email"

# Persona Flexibility Note

Ace is predominantly **Odis** - he wants playbooks, tactics, and peer-proven strategies he can execute immediately. However, his **Aaron traits** emerge when evaluating new approaches: he'll calculate the ROI, question unrealistic claims, and test on non-critical accounts before full deployment.

**Engagement approach**: Lead with tactical specifics and proof points (Odis), but be prepared to defend the math and show realistic expectations (Aaron). Never pitch theory without execution plans.

**Red flags that will lose him:**

- Vague promises without tactical breakdowns
- LinkedIn guru-style hype without results
- Corporate "family" culture messaging
- Restrictions on his autonomy or methods

**Green lights that will win him:**

- Peer success stories with specific metrics
- Tactical playbooks he can deploy this week
- Respect for his calling expertise while addressing gaps
- Results-driven, low-ego knowledge sharing
