# Caroline Boismery

AE Contact: Mike Canova
Company: Tovala
Email: cboismery@tovala.com
Persona: Celine (https://www.notion.so/Celine-27ff79b2c8ac808d9a00dbc639fde51d?pvs=21)

# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 4, 2025 - Initial discovery call (First interaction)

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: **Celine** (Lifecycle Marketing/CSM) with **Odis** (Operations) traits

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Presents as Celine - lifecycle marketing leader focused on customer retention, churn prevention, and data-driven marketing automation

**Why this classification**:
Caroline explicitly identifies as leading "lifecycle marketing at Tovala" and has been focused on building out customer journey programs (onboarding, reactivation, win-back). Her primary pain points center around identifying at-risk customers and preventing churn through automated, data-driven interventions - classic Celine territory. However, she also exhibits Odis traits through her strong emphasis on systematic processes, propensity modeling, test design, and the need for data engineering resources to operationalize her vision.

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns Across Meetings:**

- Highly transparent and direct communication style ("I will be very transparent here")
- Values efficiency and practical applications over theoretical discussions
- Focuses on tangible use cases rather than broad platform capabilities
- Recognizes resource constraints (lacks data engineer, time-pressed before vacation)
- Thinks in terms of testing frameworks, control groups, and measurable outcomes
- Prefers to research independently before committing ("spend a minute going through your website")

**Evolution/Changes Noticed:**

- N/A - First meeting

**Communication Preferences (learned over time):**

- Prefers honesty over polish (appreciated the transparent first call)
- Located in Chicago (CST timezone)
- Has hard stops on calendar - respects time boundaries
- Likes to digest information independently before next steps
- Will be away for 2 weeks (vacation planning) - follow-up needed late November

# Strategic Engagement Playbook (Updated)

**Current Stage**: Early Prospect - Initial Discovery

**What We've Learned Works:**

- Direct, practical demonstrations of specific use cases
- Acknowledging B2C vs B2B differences upfront
- Offering to tailor solutions to her specific needs
- Respecting her time and giving space to explore independently
- Being flexible about follow-up timing

**What to Avoid (learned from experience):**

- Don't assume she's familiar with the platform - she admitted knowing "very little"
- Don't oversell B2B use cases when she's explicitly B2C
- Don't push for immediate decisions - she needs time to evaluate
- Avoid adding to her tool stack anxiety ("one more tool")

**Evolving Priorities:**

1. **Meeting 1 Priority**: Understanding churn prediction and prevention capabilities, particularly for B2C meal subscription model

# Key Quotes Across All Meetings

**Meeting 1**:

- "I lead lifecycle marketing at Tovala. I joined about a year ago. We had very little programs in market, so I've been busy sort of getting everything out."
    - **Context**: Shows she's a builder/implementer who's been establishing foundational programs
- "One thing that we have yet to really spend a minute tackling is identifying customers at risk of churning prior to them churning."
    - **Context**: Primary pain point and potential entry point for AskElephant value
- "Ideal world, I have some sort of propensity model score. Right? So you give me a score when somebody hits goes over, like, seven or whatever, then this user enters a specific, like, churn combating journey."
    - **Context**: Reveals sophisticated understanding of predictive analytics and automated journey triggers
- "We do exclusively B2C... So first thing, don't really have customers calling us. They speak to us on chat or via email."
    - **Context**: Critical business model difference that affects solution fit
- "I just don't have a data engineer right now to actually run and do the modeling for me."
    - **Context**: Key resource constraint and potential value prop for AI-driven solution
- "I wanna avoid incentive as much as I can... we just need to design a test plan."
    - **Context**: Shows strategic, test-oriented thinking rather than quick-fix mentality

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions/Blockers:**

- **CMO**: Met with Adia at trade show, delegated to Caroline for evaluation
- **Data Engineering**: Resource gap - they lack dedicated data engineer for propensity modeling

**Decision Dynamics:**

- **Authority level**: Appears to have operational authority for lifecycle marketing tools and programs
- **Key influencers**: Reports to CMO who initiated contact; likely needs CMO approval for new tools
- **Budget control**: Unknown, but mentions being "buried" suggests limited bandwidth, may indicate budget constraints too
- **Decision timeline**: Extended - going away for 2 weeks, needs time to evaluate use cases

**Company Context:**

- Tovala is a B2C meal subscription service (meal prep + delivery)
- Uses Customer.io (CRM/ESP platform)
- Uses Zendesk for customer service
- Caroline joined ~1 year ago and has been building foundational lifecycle programs
- Early stages of exploring AI use cases (past few months)

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on aggregate learnings:**

1. **Follow-up timing**: Reach out end of November (after her 2-week vacation) as agreed
2. **Custom use case development**: Before next meeting, prepare B2C-specific churn prevention examples:
    - Email/chat interaction monitoring (not call-based)
    - Subscription skip pattern detection
    - Average order value decline tracking
    - Propensity scoring for automated journey triggers
3. **Address integration requirements**:
    - Confirm Customer.io integration capabilities
    - Demonstrate Zendesk chat/email monitoring
    - Show how AI can replace missing data engineer resource
4. **Prepare test framework discussion**: Caroline thinks in experiments - come prepared to discuss:
    - How to set up control vs. treatment groups
    - Measurement and attribution approach
    - Timeline to value for churn prevention workflows
5. **Minimize "tool fatigue" concerns**:
    - Position as consolidation/automation layer, not "one more tool"
    - Show how it reduces manual work vs. adding to it

**Watch for:**

- **Potential concern**: B2B platform trying to fit B2C use case - needs genuine solution fit, not force-fit
- **Opportunity**: She lacks data engineering resources - AI-driven propensity scoring could be high-value differentiator
- **Risk**: If she doesn't see clear, relevant use cases during her independent research, she may deprioritize
- **Timing**: Two-week vacation creates natural delay - don't let momentum die

# Persona Flexibility Note

Caroline exhibits **Celine** as her dominant type through her lifecycle marketing role, customer retention focus, and journey-building mindset. However, she shows **Odis** traits when discussing implementation - she wants systematic processes, propensity models, rigorous testing, and operational infrastructure. Approach with Celine-focused messaging around customer outcomes and retention impact, but be ready to pivot to Odis-style conversations about data architecture, testing frameworks, and operational efficiency when she asks technical/implementation questions.

**Meeting Analysis Notes:**

- Meeting quality: Productive first call despite Caroline's limited prep time
- Engagement level: Engaged once relevant use case identified (churn prevention)
- Openness: Very transparent about constraints and needs
- Next meeting probability: High - she explicitly said "maybe we can chat again" and Mike agreed to follow up
- Primary objection/concern: B2B vs B2C fit, tool proliferation anxiety
- Best path forward: Let her explore independently, provide tailored B2C use cases, follow up post-vacation
