They do take stuff from the Fathom and, like, copy paste it in. But if there's a way that we could essentially mitigate that step and save them some time, I know everybody would be really happy with me for that."; "Our churn we do pretty well with, like, our churn and retention rates. Last month, we were at a 95, but we're really aiming to be closer to a 98 every month."; "I definitely feel like we're a solid eight. Eight and a half... I had done, like, a ton of research. Like, I have, like, a I have a doc here on my screen, which is, like, 13 pages of, like, just stuff about it."
