# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 3, 2025 - AskElephant Product Demo & Partner Discussion

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Roger (Revenue) with Aaron (AE) traits

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Presents as classic Roger - revenue-focused CEO evaluating competitive advantage and partner economics

**Why this classification**:
Reef exhibits strong Roger characteristics as a revenue-oriented CEO focused on business growth, competitive positioning, and strategic partnerships. He immediately inquired about reseller/partner programs, commission structures (15% revenue share), and how to monetize the tool with his own clients. However, he also shows Aaron-like traits in his consultative selling approach and emphasis on customer relationships, evident in his photo documentation system for every client and his teaching mindset around digital vs. human capital.

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns Across Meetings:**

- **Relationship-First Approach**: Takes photos with everyone, maintains detailed visual documentation of connections ("Everybody's got a photo of me"), has dedicated team member (Kate) managing relationship intelligence
- **Revenue & Partnership Focus**: Immediately asked about brokerage, reseller, affiliate options before even finishing demo
- **Quick Decision Maker**: Gave verbal commitment mid-call ("You have our verbal commitment that, yes, we're gonna do this")
- **Concerned About Team Buy-In**: Repeatedly checked with team members (Eric, Kate, Bass) for consensus, worried about "scorched earth" from too many platform changes
- **Transparency & Authenticity**: Self-deprecating humor ("I can't manage my finances for the heck of him"), openly admits fears and concerns
- **Teaching/Education Mindset**: Views himself as educator to clients, mentioned "I wanna teach other clients how to utilize softwares like this"

**Communication Preferences:**

- **Highly Animated & Enthusiastic**: Uses exclamations frequently ("This is sick!", "Shut up, dude", "That's so sick")
- **Relationship-Driven Language**: Repeatedly expresses affection ("Love you, dude", "You're awesome")
- **Collaborative Decision Style**: Constantly involves team - "Eric, Kate, Bass, what are your thoughts here?"
- **Humor to Build Rapport**: Uses self-deprecating and situational humor (Mormon jokes, board game story)
- **Validates Before Committing**: Needs team confirmation even after making decisions

# Strategic Engagement Playbook

**Current Stage**: Hot Prospect  Converting to Partner

**What We've Learned Works:**

- **Address Migration Concerns Head-On**: Reef is worried about change management with his team (moved from Quantum  Fireflies  now AskElephant)
- **Offer Parallel Running Period**: Pete's suggestion to run Fireflies + AskElephant in tandem for a week resonated strongly
- **Lead with Partner Economics**: The 50% partner discount ($50/user) and 15% lifetime revenue share captured his attention immediately
- **Position as Revenue Generator**: Reef sees this as something he can resell to clients, not just an internal tool
- **Validate Team Needs**: Getting Eric, Kate, and Bass's buy-in was crucial to his decision

**What to Avoid:**

- **Don't Rush the Migration**: Reef needs reassurance about implementation lift
- **Don't Ignore Team Concerns**: Kate's comment about platform fatigue was important to acknowledge
- **Don't Assume Technical Understanding**: While Reef gets the vision, he relies on Eric for technical validation

**Current Priorities:**

- Replace Fireflies + n8n with better solution
- Maintain team productivity through transition
- Create partner revenue stream
- Solve Fireflies connection issues with Zoom
- Import historical meeting data (since March 2025)

# Key Quotes

**Revenue Focus**: "I wanna teach other clients how to utilize softwares like this. So it's a perfect thing to stack into people's software and then receive I think Fireflies gives me, I think, 30% lifetime value as long as the client stays on."

**Relationship Philosophy**: "This is what Kate does for everyone. And, Pete, you and I have a picture together. I don't think Kate found that yet... Everybody's got a photo of me."

**Change Management Concern**: "The biggest point, I don't want the team to keep feeling like I keep sending one project after another down the pipeline."

**Decision Style**: "Eric, base. Kate, what are your thoughts here?"

**Partnership Negotiation**: "I like the lifelong ones. I don't like the the end year ones... I'm game to the 15%. If it's a on lifelong, I'm stoked with that."

- **Bass Valmonte** ([bass@weassist.io](mailto:bass@weassist.io)) - Raised technical questions about data migration
