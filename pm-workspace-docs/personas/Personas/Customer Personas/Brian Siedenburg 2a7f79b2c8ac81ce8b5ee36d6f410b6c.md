Key Quotes: "We keep track of certain student metrics on a what we call a student report card that is basically just Google spreadsheets based... attendance on our live calls, their engagement within our community, and then just their overall course progress." | "It would be beautiful if we could just integrate that data into everything else, like KPIs and stuff... right now, it's kind of separated from everything else, and it's a little bit, I think, tough to interpret." | "How the results of that data actually translates to things like retention, conversion into our alumni program... I think that is a little bit of a blind spot for us at the moment."
