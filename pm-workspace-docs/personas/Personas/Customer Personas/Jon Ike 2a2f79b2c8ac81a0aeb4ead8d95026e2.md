# Meeting History

- **Current Meeting**: November 5, 2025 - Sales Team AI Strategy Session: Discussed leveraging AskElephant for coaching, objection handling framework rollout, and building Sales Culture of Excellence framework with Close/Create/Change/Communicate metrics

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 92% match with Roger (Revenue Leader)

**Classification Rationale**: Jon "Ike" is a textbook Roger persona - a revenue leader intensely focused on sales team performance through data-driven coaching. He demonstrates strategic thinking about team enablement while maintaining hands-on involvement in framework development. His approach to using AskElephant centers on identifying what makes top performers succeed and replicating those behaviors across the team. Unlike typical revenue leaders who delegate training, Ike personally develops comprehensive frameworks with measurable microskills.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

# Core Patterns (first meeting)

- Framework-driven approach: Creates structured methodologies (Sales Culture of Excellence: Close, Create, Change, Communicate)
- Measurement-focused: Wants to track specific behaviors (pause length, words per minute, questions asked)
- Coaching-oriented: Primary use case is identifying and developing rep skills
- Anti-overwhelm: Strongly prefers focused priorities over comprehensive data dumps
- Research-based: Builds training on evidence and data, not gut instinct

# Decision-Making Style

- Prioritization-first: "We can't run at everything" - focuses on one major initiative per month
- Iterative: Plans to use signals on past calls to determine next training priority
- Evidence-seeking: Wants to know "when we win and why we win"
- Team-protective: Avoids real-time notifications that would distract reps

# Aggregated Insights

# Pain Points (Priority Order)

1. Deal visibility issues - 50% of closed-loss marked as "ghosted" (dispositioning problem)
2. Data-driven decisions - Needs insights on what separates top performers from others
3. Proving ROI/impact - V2 product delays creating objection handling challenges
4. Alert fatigue - Currently overwhelmed by Slack notifications, needs weekly summaries
5. Time constraints - Limited availability (30-minute meeting window)

# Goals (Strategic Focus)

1. Better coaching - PRIMARY: Build systematic coaching based on what top reps do
2. Hit quota consistently - Track implementation of taught frameworks
3. Data-driven decisions - Use call data to prioritize next training topics
4. Increase selling time - Wants reps focused on selling, not documentation
5. Predictable revenue - Understand patterns in closed-won vs closed-lost

# Knowledge Domains Framework

Ike is building a three-domain knowledge assessment:

- **K-12 Knowledge**: Education sector expertise, storytelling with classroom scenarios
- **Product Knowledge**: SchoolAI features, handling product questions confidently
- **AI Knowledge**: General AI literacy to build buyer confidence

# Strategic Engagement Notes

# What Works

- Lead with insights and patterns, not raw data or features
- Frame everything as coaching enablement tools
- Provide weekly summaries, not real-time alerts
- Show correlation between behaviors and close rates
- Focus on replicable skills from top performers
- Respect his time constraints and prioritization approach

# What to Avoid

- Don't overwhelm with comprehensive reports or dashboards
- Don't suggest tracking everything - he's ruthlessly focused
- Don't pitch features - pitch coaching outcomes
- Don't send real-time Slack notifications
- Don't assume he wants to delegate - he's hands-on with frameworks

**November 2025 Priority**: Objection handling framework implementation tracking. Ike trained the team on this framework and wants to measure adoption throughout November before moving to next priority (likely discovery conversation quality).

**Discovered Insight**: The "ghosted" closed-loss issue (50% of losses) reveals a discovery problem. Ike hypothesizes: "People don't ghost people when we make the problem real for them." This suggests reps are selling benefits without doing proper pain discovery, leading to deals that feel good but don't close.

# Implementation Preferences

- **Reporting Cadence**: Weekly summaries only
- **Data Consumption**: Actionable insights with drill-down capability
- **Meeting Rhythm**: Likely RevOps weekly meetings with Gavin
- **Decision Timeline**: Moves quickly once priority is set, but focused on one thing at a time
