Traits That Don't Match: • Less focused on daily pipeline management

• Focused on sales efficiency and automation
• Building/evaluating forecasting tools
• Managing through company transition (downsizing)

Validation Notes: First engagement analyzing forecasting signals for CRM updates. Dustin is leading RevCast through a strategic transition, exploring partnerships/acquisitions after team downsizing. Strong technical aptitude - can iterate on AI prompts directly. Primary need: feedback on buying group role detection (champion/influencer/detractor classification). Currently lacks sample size to test signals effectively. Shows Roger persona traits with added technical depth.
Validation Status: Strong Match

# Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: November 7, 2025 - Initial consultation on forecasting signals and buying group role detection

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 85% match with Roger (Revenue Leader)
**Secondary Traits**: Shows 30% traits of technical/operations leader (unusual technical depth for revenue role)

**Classification Rationale**:
Dustin demonstrates clear Roger (Revenue Leader) persona characteristics: strategic company-level decision making, focus on sales automation and efficiency, managing through organizational transition, and exploring M&A opportunities. However, he shows unusually high technical aptitude for a revenue leader - comfortable working directly with AI prompts, signal configurations, and understanding implementation details. This suggests he may be founder/technical co-founder rather than traditional CRO, which adds complexity to the persona match.
