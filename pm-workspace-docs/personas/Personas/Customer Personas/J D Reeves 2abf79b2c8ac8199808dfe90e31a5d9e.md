"I try to have, like, a three k project minimum just because I get in situations where I'm just working on all these little things"

Traits That Don't Match: • Not a customer/prospect - this is a vendor evaluation meeting
• Does not fit any of the five customer personas (Aaron/Celine/Irina/Odis/Roger)
• This entry serves as documentation of a potential vendor relationship
Traits That Match: • N/A - This is a vendor/service provider relationship, not a customer
• J.D. is being evaluated as a potential vendor for AskElephant's rebrand
• Shows high expertise and specialization in logo design
Validation Notes: **Context:** This is NOT a customer persona entry - J.D. Reeves is a freelance brand designer being evaluated as a potential vendor for AskElephant's rebrand project.

**Meeting Purpose:** Tony Mickelsen is exploring options for logo design work while agencies (FocusLab, Matchstick) can't start until January 2026.

**Vendor Assessment:**
- Expertise Level: Very high - specializes in logo design with portfolio including major tech brands
- Pricing: Premium tier ($3k for logo exploration, $25k for brand + homepage)
- Timeline: Booked through 2025, but willing to do 1-week logo exploration sprint
- Fit: Could provide valuable pre-agency ideation to accelerate agency timeline
- Philosophy Alignment: Strong - emphasizes timeless logo design vs. trendy brand expressions

**Decision Outcome:** Tony expressed strong interest in $3k logo exploration (10 concepts, rough drafts) to be completed in next few weeks, then handed off to agency to reduce their timeline.

**Competitive Context:**
- FocusLab: 2-3 months, $36k (80 hrs/month @ $160/hr)
- Matchstick: 4 months timeline
- J.D. solo: Would be slower than agencies due to one-person capacity

**Notable Insights:**
- J.D. knows FocusLab team (Natalie, Kaylee)
- Rates Matchstick higher for innovative work vs. FocusLab's 'expected' style
- Works with Intercom at $5k/week for exploration
- Recent projects completed in <1 month timelines
