Persona: Roger (https://www.notion.so/Roger-27ff79b2c8ac80f38e6bd36a602af48b?pvs=21)

## Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: November 3, 2025 - AskElephant Product Demo & Partner Discussion

## Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: **Roger (Revenue)** with **Aaron (AE)** traits

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Presents as classic Roger - revenue-focused CEO evaluating competitive advantage and partner economics

**Why this classification**:
Reef exhibits strong Roger characteristics as a revenue-oriented CEO focused on business growth, competitive positioning, and strategic partnerships. He immediately inquired about reseller/partner programs ("Do you guys have brokerage yet or reseller?"), commission structures (15% revenue share), and how to monetize the tool with his own clients before even completing the demo. However, he also shows Aaron-like traits in his consultative selling approach and emphasis on customer relationships, evident in his photo documentation system for every client and his teaching mindset around digital vs. human capital.

## Aggregated Behavioral Insights

### Consistent Patterns Across Meetings:

- **Relationship-First Approach**: Takes photos with everyone, maintains detailed visual documentation of connections ("Everybody's got a photo of me"), has dedicated team member (Kate) managing relationship intelligence
- **Revenue & Partnership Focus**: Immediately asked about brokerage, reseller, affiliate options before even finishing demo
- **Quick Decision Maker**: Gave verbal commitment mid-call ("You have our verbal commitment that, yes, we're gonna do this")
- **Concerned About Team Buy-In**: Repeatedly checked with team members (Eric, Kate, Bass) for consensus, worried about "scorched earth" from too many platform changes
- **Transparency & Authenticity**: Self-deprecating humor ("I can't manage my finances for the heck of him"), openly admits fears and concerns
- **Teaching/Education Mindset**: Views himself as educator to clients, mentioned "I wanna teach other clients how to utilize softwares like this"

### Communication Preferences:

- **Highly Animated & Enthusiastic**: Uses exclamations frequently ("This is sick!", "Shut up, dude", "That's so sick")
- **Relationship-Driven Language**: Repeatedly expresses affection ("Love you, dude", "You're awesome")
- **Collaborative Decision Style**: Constantly involves team - "Eric, Kate, Bass, what are your thoughts here?"
- **Humor to Build Rapport**: Uses self-deprecating and situational humor (Mormon jokes, board game story)
- **Validates Before Committing**: Needs team confirmation even after making decisions

## Strategic Engagement Playbook

**Current Stage**: 🔥 Hot Prospect → Converting to Partner

### What We've Learned Works:

- **Address Migration Concerns Head-On**: Reef is worried about change management with his team (moved from Quantum → Fireflies → now AskElephant)
- **Offer Parallel Running Period**: Pete's suggestion to run Fireflies + AskElephant in tandem for a week resonated strongly
- **Lead with Partner Economics**: The 50% partner discount ($50/user) and 15% lifetime revenue share captured his attention immediately
- **Position as Revenue Generator**: Reef sees this as something he can resell to clients, not just an internal tool
- **Validate Team Needs**: Getting Eric, Kate, and Bass's buy-in was crucial to his decision

### What to Avoid:

- **Don't Rush the Migration**: Reef needs reassurance about implementation lift
- **Don't Ignore Team Concerns**: Kate's comment about platform fatigue was important to acknowledge
- **Don't Assume Technical Understanding**: While Reef gets the vision, he relies on Eric for technical validation

### Current Priorities:

1. Replace Fireflies + n8n with better solution
2. Maintain team productivity through transition
3. Create partner revenue stream
4. Solve Fireflies connection issues with Zoom
5. Import historical meeting data (since March 2025)

## Relationship Intelligence

### Internal Champions:

- ✅ **Kate** ([hello@weassist.io](mailto:hello@weassist.io)) - Executive Assistant/Operations Manager, will benefit most from automation
- ✅ **Eric** ([eric@weassist.io](mailto:eric@weassist.io)) - Technical Lead, validated AskElephant can replace n8n workflows
- ✅ **Bass Valmonte** ([bass@weassist.io](mailto:bass@weassist.io)) - Raised technical questions about data migration

### Decision Dynamics:

- **Authority Level**: Full decision-making authority as CEO
- **Key Influencers**: Kate (operations impact), Eric (technical feasibility), team morale
- **Budget Control**: Direct - approved $900/month spend mid-call

### External Connections:

- Has previous meeting with Pete (took photo together)
- Knows David Inman from SalesAI ("I love David, dude")
- Met Pete at event where WeAssist showcased offshore talent

## Business Context

**Company**: WeAssist - Offshore talent placement/staffing agency

- **Team Size**: 23 people who would use AskElephant
- **Current Stack**:
    - Fireflies (18 users @ $29/mo business plan =$ 512/mo)
    - n8n (cloud $50/mo + self-hosted$ 40-80/mo)
    - ClickUp (project management)
    - GoHighLevel (CRM)
    - Tactic (Eric uses for browser-based recording after Fireflies issues)
    - Slack (team communication)

### Use Cases Identified:

1. **Recruitment Calls**: Recording discovery calls with candidates
2. **90-Day Onboarding**: 12 sessions with new offshore professionals, wants separate tracking
3. **Client Meetings**: Sales and account management calls
4. **Team Meetings**: Internal collaboration (currently 15 Fireflies bots in one meeting - wants single bot)
5. **Historical Data**: Wants to migrate meetings since March 2025

### Pain Points:

- Fireflies doesn't reliably connect to Zoom meetings, requires manual invitation
- n8n workflows complex and fragmented
- Need better data aggregation across all calls with single client
- Manual work for Kate organizing and filing recordings
- Team experiencing platform fatigue from multiple migrations

### Data Volume:

- "So many calls every day" (Kate)
- March 2025 to present = ~8 months of recordings
- Reef "loves people" and calendar is "back to back all the time"

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:

1. ✅ **Send Customized Partner Agreement** with lifetime 15% revenue share structure
2. ✅ **Quote with Promotional Pricing**:
    - 50% partner discount = $50/user
    - Additional 50% off first month = $25/user
    - 23 users = ~$575 first month, then$ 1,150/month ongoing
3. ✅ **Assign Partner Onboarding Specialist** (Pete committed to this)

### Build Custom Workflows for:

- Recruitment discovery call format
- 90-day onboarding session tracking (12 sessions)
- Automatic Google Drive filing by meeting type
- Slack notifications to specific team members
- ClickUp task integration (coming 2-3 weeks)
- GoHighLevel CRM sync (coming right after ClickUp)

### Migration Plan:

- Run Fireflies + AskElephant in parallel until **Nov 17** (Fireflies renewal date)
- Focus on highest-volume users first (Reef, Eric)
- Calculate cost for historical data import (~$0.90/hour of calls)
- Team validation checkpoint after 1 week

### Follow-Up Opportunities:

- **Next Meeting**: Reef wants to demo GoTalentFlow and discuss cross-referral opportunities
- **Event Invitation**: Get Reef invited to December "Triple D Experts" event in Utah (David Inman/SalesAI organizing)

### Watch For:

- ⚠️ **Team adoption resistance** - Kate mentioned platform fatigue
- ⚠️ **Change management support needed** - Reef concerned about "scorched earth"
- ⚠️ **Historical data import decision** - Need to calculate value vs. cost
- ⚠️ **Partnership activation speed** - Reef claims 100-110 potential users

### Opportunity:

- 💰 Reef sees AskElephant as revenue stream before even using it himself
- 📢 Teaching/education approach means he'll likely become vocal advocate if successful
- 🤝 WeAssist offshore talent could potentially help AskElephant with implementation specialists
- 🔄 Cross-referral partnership potential (Pete's clients → WeAssist)

## Persona Flexibility Note

Reef is primarily **Roger (Revenue-focused CEO)** but exhibits **Aaron (AE)** traits in his relationship-first approach and consultative mindset. He thinks like a CEO about growth, partnerships, and competitive positioning, but operates like a top AE in how he builds relationships and educates clients.

**Engagement Strategy**: Use Roger tactics around business impact and revenue generation, but maintain the personal connection and collaborative approach that Aaron personas value.
