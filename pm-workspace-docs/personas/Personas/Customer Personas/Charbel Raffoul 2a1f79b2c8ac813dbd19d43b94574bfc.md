# Meeting History

**Meeting 1**: November 4, 2025 - Implementation Review

- Purpose: Address workflow usage issues, bugs, and pricing concerns
- Attendees: Charbel (StudioHawk), Raphael (StudioHawk), Erika Vasquez (AE), Matt Bennett (AE)
- Duration: 37 minutes
- Key Discussion: Workflow evaluation, competitive pricing analysis, potential contract termination

# Persona Validation Summary

**Primary Match**: Roger (Revenue Leader) - 85% confidence

**Secondary Traits**: Shows 20% Odis (Operations) traits due to hands-on implementation involvement

**Classification Rationale**:

Charbel exhibits strong Roger characteristics as a revenue leader with P&L responsibility, vendor evaluation authority, and cost optimization focus. His repeated emphasis on ROI (mentioned 5+ times), competitive pricing analysis ($25 vs$ 16-18), and ability to make contract termination decisions within 48 hours confirms decision-maker status. The operational involvement (having automation specialist, comparing feature sets) shows some Odis traits but doesn't override primary Roger classification.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Consistent Communication Patterns**:

- Leads with transparency: "I'll be honest with you, Erica"
- Makes financially-driven decisions with clear cost benchmarks
- Values efficiency over feature richness
- Direct about concerns: "It makes zero sense to have that workflow"
- Provides constructive product feedback unsolicited

**Decision-Making Style**:

- Build vs. buy preference when cost-effective
- Systematic competitive evaluation (Fathom, Fireflies, AskElephant)
- ROI-focused with specific price points as decision criteria
- Willing to invest time in in-house solutions to reduce costs

**Current Trajectory**:

- ⚠️ At-risk: Evaluating contract termination within 48 hours
- Only finding value in basic meeting recording feature
- Has replicated premium workflows in-house successfully
- Sales team non-adoption blocking primary workflow value

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**What Resonates** ✅:

- Direct, transparent pricing conversations
- Acknowledging competitive landscape honestly
- Creative workarounds (HubSpot notes integration idea)
- ROI-focused feature suggestions: His feedback on sentiment tracking ROI report shows he wants to see financial impact quantified
- Accepting feedback without defensiveness

**What Falls Flat** ❌:

- Feature-selling without cost justification
- Pushing workflows that don't fit team structure
- Ignoring adoption barriers (sales team resistance)
- Assuming all workflows have equal value
- Premium pricing without differentiated value

**Recommended Engagement Strategy**:

1. **Immediate (24-48 hours)**:
- Quantify cost savings from current meeting summary workflow
- Provide detailed ROI analysis: time saved, meetings processed, value delivered
- Address billing transparency feedback with product update
1. **Short-term (1-2 weeks)**:
- Propose adjusted pricing tier for meeting-only usage
- Demo HubSpot notes integration for sales-CS handoff
- Create custom ROI dashboard showing value vs. cost
1. **Long-term**:
- Position as strategic partner, not just vendor
- Build features that work with their constraints
- Regular ROI reviews to maintain value visibility

**Red Flags to Monitor** 🚩:

- Contract termination under active consideration (48-hour window)
- Has viable alternatives identified and priced
- Internal team can replicate workflows at 1/3 the cost
- Primary champion not seeing differentiated value
- Sales team adoption barrier unresolved

# Key Insights for Sales/CS Teams

**Critical Success Factors**:

- Must demonstrate clear ROI vs. $16-18/seat competitors within 48 hours
- Any solutions must integrate with existing HubSpot workflow
- Solutions must work despite sales team non-adoption
- Pricing model needs to reflect actual usage patterns

**Deal Risk Assessment**: HIGH

- Mitigation: ROI quantification + pricing adjustment + creative integration

**Expansion Opportunities** (if retention secured):

- Custom ROI reporting dashboard
- HubSpot-native integration for sales team
- Sentiment tracking with financial impact measurement
- Automation consulting (he values this expertise)

**Communication Preferences**:

- Style: Direct, no fluff
- Frequency: Responsive but respects time
- Format: Prefers async communication with concrete data
- Decision Timeline: Fast - makes decisions within days, not weeks
