# Meeting History

- **2025-11-14**: Initial training call with Mike - LinkedIn outreach strategies demonstration, AskElephant pitch, agreed to warm intro to manager

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 75% match with Aaron (AE)

**Secondary Traits**: Shows early-stage sales rep characteristics

**Classification Rationale**:
Assigned Aaron (AE) persona because Daniel's daily challenges align with front-line sales roles (manual CRM work, coaching gaps, quota pressure), though he's at SDR level rather than AE level. His manager Gabby D'Angelo would be the actual decision maker for AskElephant, but Daniel demonstrates strong champion potential.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Consistent Patterns** (First Meeting):

- Highly coachable and eager to learn new strategies
- Authentic, casual communication style - doesn't try to oversell himself
- Natural connector personality - volunteered multiple warm intro paths
- Values efficiency and automation to maximize selling time
- Active on LinkedIn but seeking guidance on best practices

**Career Context**:

- Just started at Mountain (in first few weeks)
- Part of 12-person SDR training cohort
- Previously had viral TikTok videos, comfortable with social content

# Aggregated Insights

**Pain Points (Frequency in Conversation)**:

- Manual CRM updates after calls (mentioned 4+ times) - HIGH PRIORITY
- Cold calling challenges and low connect rates (3 times)
- Building appropriate LinkedIn presence (2 times)
- Limited manager coaching bandwidth (1 time)
- Context handoff to AEs (1 time)

**Goals Consistency**:

- Primary: Hit 25 meetings/month quota (hybrid: 50% inbound, 50% outbound)
- Secondary: Build LinkedIn personal brand without violating company policy
- Emerging: Shift from cold calling to warm LinkedIn-based outreach

**Tech Stack at Mountain**:

- CRM: Salesforce
- Call Recording: Gong (but limited coaching usage by manager)
- Sales Engagement: Outreach (sequences/email)
- Dialer: Nooks (with team collaboration rooms)
- Data/Intelligence: Cognism
- Collaboration: Slack, Google Workspace
- Social Selling: LinkedIn Sales Navigator

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**What Works** (Proven in this call):

- Provide genuine value first before asking for anything in return
- Mike offered LinkedIn training before requesting intro to manager
- Acknowledge his non-buyer status while respecting his influence
- Speak to both personal benefits AND team/manager benefits
- Offer reciprocal value (engagement on his LinkedIn post)

**What Doesn't** (To Avoid):

- Don't pitch him directly as if he's the buyer
- Don't ignore the manager relationship - he needs to feel comfortable making intro
- Don't rush the ask - he offered intro organically after value exchange

**Decision Maker Map at Mountain**:

1. **Gabby D'Angelo** (SDR Manager) - PRIMARY TARGET
    - Manages ~10 SDRs including Daniel
    - Faces coaching scalability challenge (250+ calls/week across team)
    - Daniel reports directly to her
2. **Severin** (Go-to-Market Architect/RevOps) - SECONDARY TARGET
    - "Very into tech" according to Daniel
    - RevOps persona - ideal fit for AskElephant
    - Daniel didn't interview with him (different team)
3. **Brenna Storm** (Recruiter) - TERTIARY
    - Helped Daniel get the job
    - Active on LinkedIn
    - Could be alternative warm intro path

**Daniel's Commitments**:

- Consider reaching out to Severin (RevOps) as alternative path
