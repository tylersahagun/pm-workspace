# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: 2025-11-10 - Partner Weekly sync with AskElephant team to discuss process automation, deal flow, and mutual product adoption

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 75% match with Aaron (AE)
**Secondary Traits**: Shows 40% traits of Irina (Implementation) due to technical configuration focus

**Classification Rationale**:
Blake functions as an AE/Partner Manager at Supered with strong technical implementation skills. While he carries quota responsibility and focuses on converting end users, he also handles significant product configuration and partner enablement. His role blends traditional AE responsibilities (pipeline management, partner relationships) with implementation expertise (building process rules, technical configurations). The Aaron persona fits best due to his focus on scaling deal volume, quota attainment, and efficiency.
