    **Q: What is a Product Persona?
    A:** A product persona is a characterization of your product, service, or solution as if it were a person. It embodies the unique features, qualities, and attributes of your offering. The purpose of creating a product persona is to humanize your product, making it easier for you or your team to understand its value proposition, strengths, weaknesses, and target market.

    **Q: Why do I need to create my Product Persona?**
    
    **A:** Creating product personas is crucial because they bring your target audience to life. Product personas represent the various segments of your audience, helping you understand their preferences, needs, behaviors, and pain points. By creating detailed personas, you gain a deep insight into the motivations behind your customers' decisions. This insight guides your strategy, product development, and marketing efforts, ensuring that you tailor your offerings to truly resonate with your audience.
    
    ---
    
    **Q: What if I have more than 1 Target Group, how many Product Personas do I have to create?**
    
    **A:** If you have multiple target groups, it's recommended to create a product persona for each distinct group. Each persona will capture the unique characteristics, preferences, and pain points of that specific group of your audience. 
    By creating individual personas for different target groups, you ensure that your strategy addresses the specific needs of each group accurately. 
    This approach helps you tailor your products and messaging more effectively, ultimately leading to better engagement and success within each target group of your audience.

### Bio

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/user-circle_red.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/user-circle_red.svg" width="40px" /> Irina is a 27-year-old Implementation Specialist at a SaaS company in Utah, working across remote and hybrid teams. Highly organized yet adaptable, Irina is the glue between Sales, Customer Success, and the customer’s own team in those hectic first weeks post-sale.

Irina likes to say their job is “making the product real” for the customer: solving problems, translating goals into setup steps, and ensuring teammates never lose a detail at handoff. Ultra-comfortable with SaaS tools and productivity apps, Irina thrives on checklists, automation, and finding the right hack to move things faster.

Success is measured in rapid onboarding milestones, high adoption rates, and handing off happy, well-trained customers to Success—despite a calendar crammed with overlapping calls and constant need for context. Irina’s daily grind includes parsing incomplete information from Sales, tracking dozens of micro-tasks, and balancing customer patience with internal resource constraints.

The best days? Projects that close fast, teams that collaborate seamlessly, and moments where Irina saves the day by catching what everyone else missed.

- Incomplete customer context at handoff makes it hard to deliver on promises
- Overloaded calendar leaves little time to track down missing info
- Repeated manual follow-ups for action items—leads to frustration and inefficiency
- Juggling multiple customers across platforms, tools, and time zones
- Escalations or project delays from missed or hidden tasks in the chaos
</aside>

- 💡Tip
    
    Pain points are persistent problems with a product/service that can inconvenience customers and their businesses. These are unmet needs waiting to be satisfied.
    

### Fears

- Fear of missing key detail that causes a project to go off-track
- Frustration that “one more tool” just creates more work or fragmentation
- Anxiety about being blamed for problems caused by poor handoff or unclear responsibilities
- Worried about manual systems leading to embarrassing mistakes
- Fear that repeat errors or escalations damage internal/external relationships
</aside>

- 💡Tip
    
    Think about what might be holding your customers back from buying your product/service. Helping them to put their fears aside is a great way to build a strong relationship with them.

1. *As a `[Persona]`, I `[Need/Goal]` because `[Pain]`, but `[Fear]`.*
2. As an Implementation Specialist, I need full access to sales and discovery notes because I'm responsible for executing on promises made but I fear missing critical details at the handoff.
3. As an Implementation Specialist, I need project and task automation because I’m juggling multiple customers simultaneously, but I fear important steps will slip without robust reminders.
4. As an Implementation Specialist, I need a single source of truth for onboarding tasks because scattered checklists cost time and introduce errors, but I fear adopting “one more tool” that isn’t adopted widely.
5. As an Implementation Specialist, I need to collaborate seamlessly with Success and Product because onboarding requirements often reveal gaps, but I fear poor communication will cause embarrassment or escalate issues.
6. As an Implementation Specialist, I need to measure onboarding completion and user adoption because these are my success metrics, but I fear not being able to demonstrate impact if data is siloed or inaccurate.
