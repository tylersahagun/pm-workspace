Traits That Don't Match: • Not a product user or day-to-day operator
• Not in sales/CS/operations role
• Focus is on investment thesis, not tool adoption
• Role is investor/board member, not revenue team member
• Concerns are about fundraising readiness, not CRM pain points
Traits That Match: • Strategic thinker focused on high-level business outcomes
• Collaborative advisor working alongside CEO
• Results-focused with emphasis on metrics and preparation
• Values structured thinking and operationalization
Validation Notes: Jason is a board member/investor from Jump Capital, not a typical client persona. He operates as a strategic advisor focused on:

• Fundraising readiness and timing (Q1 2026 target)
• Team gaps (urgent need for technical product leader)
• Market positioning and buzz creation
• Investor relationship building strategy
• Financial metrics and runway management

This represents a stakeholder type outside our current ICP. He's evaluating AskElephant's investment potential, not using the product. His pain points relate to portfolio company preparation for Series A/B fundraising, not RevTech operational challenges.

Match confidence is very low (15%) because none of our personas (Aaron/Celine/Irina/Odis/Roger) capture investor/advisor behavior patterns.
Validation Status: ❌ Poor Match (<60%)

# Meeting History

**Meeting 1: November 5, 2025** - Board/investor check-in discussing fundraising readiness, technical hiring, and Q1 2026 raise timing

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 15% - Does not match any existing persona

**Classification**: Investor/Board Member (outside current ICP)

**Classification Rationale**:

Jason operates as a strategic board advisor and investor, not as a revenue team operator. His focus is entirely on company-level strategic issues: fundraising positioning, team composition, market readiness, and investor relationship building. None of our current personas (Aaron/Celine/Irina/Odis/Roger) capture this stakeholder type, as they're designed for revenue operations team members who use tools daily.

The low match confidence reflects that his concerns (technical leadership gaps, fundraising narrative, investor relationships) are fundamentally different from operational efficiency pain points (manual CRM work, handoff context, forecasting accuracy) that our personas experience.
