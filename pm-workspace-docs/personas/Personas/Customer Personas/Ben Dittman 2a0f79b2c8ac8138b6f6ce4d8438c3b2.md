# Meeting History

- Previous meetings: Working with AskElephant at CodingScape (got them signed up last week)
- Meeting 1: November 3, 2025 - Supporting Braided's evaluation as consultant/advisor

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Odis (Operations) - Confirmed

**Persona Journey**:

- Previous interactions: Demonstrated classic Odis behavior at CodingScape
- Meeting 1: Further confirmed Odis classification through focus on operational workflows, EOS implementation, and cross-functional automation

**Why this classification**:
Ben is a textbook Odis (Operations) persona. He operates as a consultant helping companies optimize their operations and implement better systems. His focus areas are quintessentially Odis:

- Building workflow automations to track quarterly rocks and milestones
- Implementing EOS/L10 meeting frameworks and tracking
- Creating data strategy and aggregating information across meetings
- Focused on keeping teams aligned and on track with automated status updates
- Thinking about seamless handoffs and streamlined processes
- He's the person who says "I want it to be able to help guy out and me out to say, technically, okay. This is this is what people continue to ask for, or here's continuous themes on problems"

This is pure operations thinking - finding patterns, automating status tracking, reducing friction, enabling cross-team success.

# Strategic Engagement Playbook

**Current Stage**: Active Customer + Referral Source

**Evolving Priorities:**

1. Initial Priority: Basic meeting capture and CRM automation
2. Expanded Priority: Complex workflow automation (rocks/milestones tracking, L10 integration)
3. Current Priority: Multi-company access, becoming an implementation partner for clients
4. Future Priority: Potentially becoming a formal partner/reseller
