# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 3, 2025 - Partnership Role Interview / Discovery Call

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Aaron (Primary) with Roger (Secondary) traits

**Why**: Josh is revenue-focused professional driven by ownership and creation, not just closing deals. Entrepreneurial builder mindset. Shows Roger traits through partnership focus and strategic thinking.

Key indicators: Accounting background but chose sales, started two businesses, values ownership over metrics, thrives in chaos, managing Australia territory solo, partnership experience.

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Patterns**: Deep need for autonomy/ownership, entrepreneurial mindset, values creation over execution, burned out from startups but still drawn to chaos, self-aware about unlocking potential, thrives with territory ownership, partnership-savvy.

**Motivations**: Ultimate goal is own business (recovering from burnout), needs environment to own something, satisfaction from "having a mountain to climb," not motivated by quota alone.

**Communication**: Self-reflective, asks clarifying questions, values transparency, responds well to direct challenges, LDS mission in Thailand with James.

# Strategic Engagement Playbook

**Stage**: Prospect - Partnership Role Candidate

**Resonated**: Partnership role with ownership, acknowledgment of AskElephant difficulty, unlocking potential discussion, high-risk/high-reward, dual quota/building role, James connection.

**Avoid**: Overselling fun, positioning as pure execution, comparing to standard AE role, not addressing burnout.

**Decision Factors**: 1) Ownership needs, 2) Trust (skeptical after Netgain), 3) Push vs grind balance, 4) Timing (Australia offer, December return), 5) Standards (Woody's "unlock potential").

# Key Quotes

**Core**: "I think when I think of ownership, another word I'd use is creation... something that wouldn't be as good if I wasn't there." *Primary driver is building, not sales numbers.*

**Motivation**: "I'm just happier if I have a mountain to climb and it's on me and I do it, I get satisfaction from that." *Internally driven, thrives under pressure with ownership.*

**Woody's Impact**: "[Woody said] I seem like someone who gets what I want but hasn't unlocked true potential yet... that guides my decisions." *This assessment still drives him.*

**Burnout**: "I got scarred from that startup... two to three all nighters a week... almost traumatic." *Needs sustainable pace reassurance.*

**Dilemma**: "Last thing I want is to feel stuck for two years with no power to do anything." *Evaluating Netgain vs AskElephant.*

# Relationship Intelligence

**Champions**: James (LDS mission together, strong), Woody (Divvy manager, positive impression), Robert Henderson (this interview).

**Dynamics**: Full autonomy, influenced by James (trust), Woody (credibility), past trauma (fear). Alternative: Netgain Australia 2-year offer (December return).

**Context**: Lives in Australia solo, speaks Thai, accounting background turned sales, ex-Divvy post-acquisition.

# Next Steps

**Actions**: 1) James follow-up on ownership/creation, 2) Show PRM territory ownership examples, 3) Address burnout with sustainable pace clarity, 4) Consider Woody reconnection, 5) Move quickly (December timeline).

**Pitch**: Lead with ownership of partnership motion, address creation (20 to 200 partners), acknowledge risk but highlight building opportunity, connect to future business ownership, set high bar with actual resources/trust.

**Watch**: Risk - might choose safe Netgain offer; Opportunity - rare partnership experience; Risk - burnout trauma; Opportunity - James leverage; Risk - December pressure.

**Red Flags**: Ownership without accountability, burnout dominates excitement, using as Netgain leverage.

# Persona Flexibility

Primarily Aaron (AE/Revenue entrepreneurial) but strong Roger traits (strategic, partnership, GTM building). Not pure hunter-closer; he's builder-closer.

Approach with Aaron strategies (ownership, territory, impact, growth) but engage Roger side for partnership strategy, processes, distribution innovation.

**Critical**: Must see as "building business within business" not "being AE for partners."
