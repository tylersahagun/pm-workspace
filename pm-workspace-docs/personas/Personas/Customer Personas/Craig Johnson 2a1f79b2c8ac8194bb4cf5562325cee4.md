Persona: Aaron (https://www.notion.so/Aaron-27ff79b2c8ac80bbadfde2c62efe9691?pvs=21)

# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 4, 2025 - Initial discovery call with Matchstic branding agency

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Aaron (Account Executive/Business Development) with Celine (Relationship Management) traits

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Strong Aaron characteristics - lead qualifier, discovery expert, consultative selling approach, budget discussion comfort, partnership builder

**Why this classification**:
Craig demonstrates classic Aaron behaviors as a partner/cofounder at Matchstic who leads upfront scoping and client acquisition. He immediately positioned himself as the discovery lead ("I'm one of the partners and cofounders of Matchstic...help with a lot of this upfront doping and everything"). His approach was quintessentially consultative - asking clarifying questions about brand strategy scope, delineating between messaging and homepage copy, and working to understand Tony's exact needs before proposing solutions. He showed comfort navigating budget discussions, introducing the $100-150K range while reading the room and pivoting to alternative engagement models (retainer vs. fixed fee). His ability to reference past client work (Karoo eyewear brand with elephant mascot, CRM client rebuilding with AI) demonstrated social proof selling. He also exhibited Celine traits through relationship-building ("one of our favorite clients you're connected to" - Ashley Havili reference) and long-term thinking ("I'd love to pull some stuff together...have a follow-up meeting").

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns Across Meetings:**

- Discovery-first approach: Asked clarifying questions before pitching solutions
- Consultative selling: "Tell me...when it comes to brand strategy, like, I'm you know...is it yes, no, or somewhere in between"
- Budget transparency: Introduced pricing early to qualify fit
- Active listening: Picked up on Tony's cues about where help was needed most
- Partnership framing: "We've done things that are similar to that" - showing flexibility
- Relationship investment: Researched Tony's LinkedIn, found mutual connection

**Communication Preferences:**

- Visual presentation style: "Let me show you this real quick" with slide deck
- Collaborative tone: "We'd love to...we can kinda..." - inclusive language
- Humor and warmth: Opened with self-deprecating humor about AskElephant judging his performance
- Structured follow-up: Immediately moved to schedule next meeting with clear agenda

# Strategic Engagement Playbook (Updated)

**Current Stage**: Active Prospect - Discovery Phase Complete, Moving to Proposal

**What We've Learned Works:**

- Transparency about budget constraints and decision-making authority
- Intellectual curiosity about the product and brand philosophy
- Appreciation for detailed thinking and strategic rationale
- Openness to flexible engagement models (retainer vs. project)
- Quick decision-making style when aligned on value

**What to Avoid:**

- Assuming unlimited budget - CEO approval needed for $100K+ investments
- Over-promising on timeline - they need momentum for Q2 2025 Series A
- Generic pitches - they've clearly researched multiple agencies
- Ignoring their DIY capabilities - they have in-house design and strong positioning sense

**Current Priorities:**

1. Meeting 1 Priority: Understanding scope (visual branding #1, messaging refinement #2, light brand strategy guidance #3)
2. Budget/Timeline Constraint: Must show ROI for Series A fundraise (Q2 2025)
3. Decision Dynamic: Craig is champion but needs CEO buy-in for full investment

# Key Quotes Across All Meetings

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions/Blockers:**

- Partner with: Amanda Klein (Client Coordinator) - handles logistics and onboarding
- Reports to: Appears to be partner-level, but defers to CEO for major budget decisions at client side
- Influences: Tony Mickelsen directly; needs to influence AskElephant CEO for budget approval

**Decision Dynamics:**

- Authority level: High for scoping and initial proposals; Medium for final pricing (needs Tony's CEO buy-in)
- Key influencers: Tony Mickelsen (VP Marketing, primary decision-maker); AskElephant CEO (budget authority)
- Budget control: Can commit to $10-20K/month retainers;$ 100K+ needs executive approval
- Evaluation criteria: ROI for Series A positioning, speed/momentum, strategic guidance + execution blend

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on aggregate learnings:**

1. **Prepare Thursday follow-up with**: Custom approach deck showing 3-tier options (Full soup-to-nuts $150K, Hybrid retainer model$ 60-80K front-loaded, Strategic advisor + DIY support $30-40K)
2. **Emphasize Series A positioning**: Show case studies or testimonials about pre-fundraise brand refreshes that improved investor perception
3. **Highlight speed and agility**: AskElephant values quick decision-making and cutting corners wisely - position Matchstic as nimble partner
4. **Lean into the human-centric AI angle**: Craig resonated deeply with the "AI to make humans more human" philosophy vs. Jetsons tech-forward vibe
5. **Reference relevant work**: Prepare Karoo case study and any other B2B SaaS brand refreshes for startups in 50-500 employee range

**Watch for:**

- CEO involvement: If Tony brings founder to next meeting, it signals serious consideration and budget availability
- Timeline pressure: Q2 2025 fundraise means work needs to start by early 2025 at latest
- Competitive landscape: Tony mentioned "talking with other companies right now" - move with urgency
- DIY vs. full-service tension: Tony has strong opinions and in-house resources - find the right collaboration model

# Persona Flexibility Note

Craig exhibits **Aaron (Account Executive)** as his dominant type - he's clearly in a business development and client acquisition role as partner/cofounder. However, he shows strong **Celine (Customer Success)** traits in his relationship-building approach, long-term partnership mindset, and collaborative problem-solving style. He's not just closing deals; he's building lasting client relationships. Approach with consultative selling strategies but emphasize partnership, flexibility, and post-sale collaboration when discussing engagement models.
