# Persona Validation Summary
**Match Confidence**: 75% match with Roger (Revenue Leader)
**Secondary Traits**: Shows 25% traits of Aaron (AE) - relationship building focus

**Classification Rationale**:
Darnel demonstrates Roger's strategic revenue leadership through his focus on go-to-market strategies, lead generation, and systematic approach to market research. However, he's more hands-on than a typical Roger, personally hosting the podcast and executing business development. The company is only 1 year old, suggesting he's in a founder/growth leader role combining strategic vision with tactical execution.
