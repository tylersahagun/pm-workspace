# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 85% match with **Roger (Revenue Leader)**

**Secondary Traits**: Shows 30% traits of Odis (Operations) due to hands-on tech stack management

**Classification Rationale**:
Aaron is classified as Roger (Revenue Leader) based on his strategic revenue focus, decision-making authority, and ownership of sales outcomes. Despite having a "Director of Marketing" title, he clearly owns the revenue function and evaluates solutions through an ROI lens.

Key evidence:

- Direct statement: "we like sales because that equals money"
- Outcome focus: "Make our guys sell better"
- ROI evaluation: "The real question is, what does that whole lot of sense cost?"

- Revenue outcome focus over features
- Strategic evaluation of cost vs. benefit
- Direct, no-nonsense communication style
- Problem identification before solution evaluation
- Protective of leadership time (gatekeeper role)

**Evolution Observed**:

- **Initially**: Skeptical about post-call vs real-time capabilities for B2C use case
- **Mid-call**: Engaged when B2B recruiting pain point was addressed
- **End-call**: Committed to pilot and scheduled leadership presentation
- **Trajectory**: Moving from evaluation to implementation phase

**Decision-Making Style**:

- Pragmatic and ROI-focused
- Quick to identify "lowest hanging fruit"
- Realistic about internal challenges
- Values pilots over big commitments
- Wants proof before leadership presentation

# Strategic Engagement Notes
