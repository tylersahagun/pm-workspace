Validation Notes: Ivy is Sales Ops Specialist with minimal participation in this training call. Her brief introduction established her focus on sales team support and tech stack management. Did not ask questions or engage in workflow discussion. Likely observing to understand tool capabilities before determining ops use cases. Her role naturally aligns with Odis (Operations) but limited data makes confident assessment difficult. May be more hands-on implementer than strategic thinker based on "specialist" title vs management role.
Validation Status: ⚠️ Partial Match (60-79%)
