Detected Role: BDR/SDR
Email: eze@latamcent.com
Key Quotes: 1. 'I've been really good on social selling and using LinkedIn... but not to an extent where I can scale it. It's been really one to one.'

2. 'The new company I'm joining doesn't have a clear sales leader. So if I was waiting for enablement to get me better and craft the playbook, I was gonna be screwed. Thankfully, I learned that's not the way to go about sales.'

3. 'I became your hiring guy... that's great because I like to help people, but that's not gonna bring in any revenue. It builds brand, but not really what I need to do right now.'

Tools Mentioned: ChatGPT, Condo, Fathom, HubSpot, LinkedIn
Traits That Don't Match: • Currently in BDR role, not full cycle AE
• Less experience with full sales cycle management
• Still developing LinkedIn strategy (not yet at expert level)
• New to company without established relationships
• ICP targets CFOs/Finance Directors rather than sales leaders
Traits That Match: • Highly active on LinkedIn with focus on social selling
• Self-motivated to build own playbooks without enablement
• Strong value-based approach to outreach
• Transitioning from LATAM Cent to Meow (fintech)
• Eager to learn and implement best practices
• Data science background with coding knowledge
• Focus on personalization over volume in outreach
Validation Notes: Eze is transitioning to a new BDR role at Meow (fintech) after leaving LATAM Cent. He demonstrates strong Aaron (AE) persona traits through his proactive LinkedIn strategy, self-driven approach to building playbooks, and focus on relationship-based selling. However, he's currently in a BDR capacity targeting CFOs/Finance Directors rather than full-cycle AE work.

Key insight: He's seeking to evolve his LinkedIn content strategy from career advice (attracting aspiring SDRs) to content that reaches his actual ICP (CFOs and finance leaders). This shows strategic thinking about influence and reach.

He's highly receptive to coaching and immediately applies insights. His data science background gives him technical aptitude. Strong cultural fit with AskElephant's values around self-enablement and relationship-driven sales.
Validation Status: Strong Match
