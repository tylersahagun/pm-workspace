# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 94% match with Irina (Implementation)
**Secondary Traits**: Shows 35% traits of Odis (Operations) due to process-building focus

**Classification Rationale**:
Tyler is clearly in an implementation role, handling complex HubSpot migrations, data field mapping, and technical integrations. However, he's evolved beyond typical implementation work into building automation and enabling the team. He demonstrates deep technical knowledge, manages multiple complex projects (Potter's House migration example), and creates workflows that others can use. He's the bridge between technical work and team enablement.
