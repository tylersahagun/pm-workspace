# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 4, 2025 (2:27 PM MST) - Initial call screening attempt

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Roger (Revenue Leader) - TENTATIVE - Requires validation in future substantive meetings

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Initial call screening provided minimal data. Tentatively classified as Roger based on context of discussing pilot timing and preseed funding round closing, which suggests involvement in business development and revenue operations.

**Why this classification**:
The brief call screening mentioned "pilot timing" and "preseed funding round closing for Legal Tech Media Group," which are revenue-related strategic topics typically handled by CRO, VP Sales, or similar revenue leadership roles (Roger persona). However, this is a WEAK signal requiring validation. The interaction was too brief (40 seconds of call screening) to assess communication style, decision-making patterns, or behavioral traits that would confirm persona fit.

**6A7 Data Quality Note**: This assessment is based on a 40-second call screening interaction, not a substantive meeting. Persona classification should be considered preliminary until more behavioral data is gathered.

**Awaiting Additional Meetings:**

**Meeting 1 (Nov 4, 2025 - Call Screening)**: "To talk to Kathy Kenton about oh, my name is Janice. And to talk to her about, like, the pilot timing and, uh, presede funding round closing for Legal Tech Media Group."

Context: Initial call screening showing interest in AskElephant pilot aligned with their funding timeline. Note: Transcript shows "Janice" but attendee records show "Cathy Kenton" - likely transcription error.

# Persona Flexibility Note

6A7 **PRELIMINARY CLASSIFICATION** - This persona assignment is based on minimal data from a brief call screening interaction. Cathy Kenton exhibits potential Roger (Revenue Leader) characteristics based on discussing pilot timing and funding round alignment, which suggests strategic business development involvement. However, she could equally be:

- **Aaron** (Sales/AE) if she's directly managing the sales process
- **Celine** (Customer Success) if focused on customer outcomes
- **Odis** (Operations) if managing operational implementation
- **Irina** (Implementation) if focused on technical deployment

**Primary strategy:** Approach with Roger framework (strategic, revenue-focused, timeline-driven) but be prepared to pivot based on her actual role, communication style, and priorities revealed in the first substantive meeting.

**Next meeting is critical** to establish accurate persona classification through observing:

- How she describes her role and responsibilities
- What problems/challenges she emphasizes
- Her communication style and technical depth
- Her decision-making authority and process
- What success metrics matter to her

**Data Quality Score: 1/10** - Requires substantive meeting to build reliable profile.
