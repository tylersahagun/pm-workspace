# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 3, 2025 - Weekly AskE x Motivosity Sync (present but did not speak)

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Roger (The Manager/Overseer)

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Identified as Roger based on contextual references to his involvement in team decisions, resource planning, and organizational oversight

**Why this classification**:
Christopher was mentioned in the context of team-level decisions and resource management, which suggests a managerial or oversight role. Specifically, he was referenced regarding new employee onboarding ("Christopher said that someone was starting this week that was gonna need a seat in AskElephant"). This type of involvement - knowing about new hires, participating in resource allocation discussions, and being included in strategic sync meetings without needing to speak - indicates a Roger persona: someone who oversees operations, manages teams, and needs visibility into implementation details without necessarily being in the weeds of execution.

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns Across Meetings:**

- Involved in team planning and resource decisions
- Participates in strategic sync meetings as an observer/stakeholder
- Aware of team staffing changes and onboarding needs
- Included in vendor relationship management (attends weekly syncs)

**Communication Preferences:**

- Observational participation style - present to stay informed
- Likely reviews outcomes and decisions rather than driving technical discussions
- May prefer asynchronous updates or summaries over active participation

# Strategic Engagement Playbook

**Current Stage**: Established Customer - Oversight/Stakeholder Role

**What We've Learned Works:**

- Include him in strategic sync meetings for visibility
- Keep him informed of major changes and decisions
- Don't require active participation - his presence indicates he values awareness

**What to Avoid:**

- Don't expect him to jump into technical workflow discussions
- Avoid bypassing him on team-level decisions or resource needs
- Don't assume silence means disengagement

**Current Priorities:**

1. **Team Enablement**: Ensuring team has proper access and resources
2. **Vendor Relationship Health**: Monitoring AskElephant partnership progress
3. **Resource Management**: Overseeing proper user seat allocation and cost
4. **Implementation Success**: Ensuring Tom and team are getting value

# Key Quotes Across All Meetings

**Meeting 1**: [No direct quotes - did not speak in this meeting]
Context: His involvement was referenced by Parker regarding new employee onboarding and user seat management decisions.

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions/Blockers:**

- Oversees: Tom Morrell (implementer), Mark Evans (workflow builder)
- Coordinates with: Doris (who has authority over user access decisions)
- Team role: Likely Sales/Customer Success leadership or Operations management
- External relationship: Parker Alexander (AskElephant AE)

**Decision Dynamics:**

- Authority level: Manager/Director - has visibility and input on team decisions
- Key influencers: Works with or reports to Doris on resource/budget decisions
- Implementation involvement: Oversight rather than hands-on
- Strategic involvement: Monitors vendor relationships and team adoption

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on aggregate learnings:**

1. **Executive Summaries**: Consider providing Christopher with periodic summary updates on implementation progress, workflow adoption, and team wins. He may not need meeting-by-meeting details but wants to know the big picture.
2. **Success Metrics**: Since he's in an oversight role, he likely cares about adoption rates, time savings, and ROI. Prepare data that shows team usage and value delivered.
3. **Escalation Path**: Understand that Christopher may be the person to involve if there are team adoption challenges, resource constraints, or strategic decisions needed.
4. **Respect His Time**: His quiet observation style suggests he values efficiency. Don't require his active participation unless strategic input is needed.

**Watch for:**

- If Tom or the team hits roadblocks, Christopher may need to get involved
- Budget or resource decisions may require his approval or advocacy
- He may speak up on strategic direction or priorities but defer technical details to Tom
- His continued attendance signals the AskElephant relationship is important enough for management oversight

# Persona Flexibility Note

Christopher appears to be a Roger persona - the manager who oversees implementation and maintains visibility without being in the tactical weeds. However, we have very limited data from this first meeting since he did not speak. He may also exhibit Odis (Economic Buyer) traits if he has budget authority, or could be a senior Celine if he's more operationally hands-on than indicated. Future meetings will help confirm whether he's pure Roger or has secondary persona characteristics.

**Data Confidence Level**: Low-Medium - Need more meeting observations to fully confirm persona. His silence could indicate:

- Senior oversight role (Roger)
- Budget authority requiring presence (Odis traits)
- Simply a busy day where he monitored but didn't need to contribute
- Learning mode as a newer stakeholder

**Next meeting priority**: Observe whether Christopher speaks up on strategic/budget topics (confirming Roger/Odis) or remains observational.
