# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 3, 2025 - AskElephant Onboarding Call

# Persona Evolution

### Current Assessment: Celine (Customer Success Leader)

### Persona Journey

- Meeting 1: Clearly identified as CS team leader - 'I head up the CS team' - exploring AskElephant for team coaching, performance management, and customer retention workflows

### Why this classification

Jarom exhibits all hallmarks of the Celine persona:

- Role: Leads a Customer Success team at Brevium
- Primary motivations: Automated coaching for his CS reps, churn risk analysis, team performance insights, and consolidated customer context
- Pain points: Needs unified visibility across team calls, wants to prevent information silos, struggles with coaching prep time
- Goals: Drive retention through proactive team management, get actionable insights on rep performance, automate routine tasks to focus on strategic coaching
- Decision-making style: Methodical and collaborative - wants to test workflows personally before rolling out to team, interested in being 'pretty involved' with workflow configuration
- Tech-savvy: Comfortable with Salesforce, Slack, Zoom recordings, and excited about CS platform integrations like Planhat

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

### Consistent Patterns Across Meetings

- Highly organized and systematic in approach - asked detailed questions about workflow mechanics
- Values autonomy and hands-on control - wants to understand 'ins and outs of workflows' and be 'pretty involved'
- Team-first mindset - repeatedly focused on what would help his reps succeed
- Quality-focused - wants to test outputs before full deployment ('I wanna test it initially')
- Proactive problem-solver - already thinking about future integrations (Planhat) and advanced use cases

### Communication Preferences

- Prefers structured learning - appreciated the slide deck and systematic product tour
- Asks clarifying questions to ensure understanding ('Remind me how do I get the output again?')
- Takes notes during calls (mentioned 'just taking a note')
- Collaborative communication style - open to suggestions but also contributes ideas
- Responsive and engaged - quick to understand concepts and apply them to his context

# Strategic Engagement Playbook (Updated)

### Current Stage

New Customer - 60-day pilot phase, Day 1 of onboarding

### What We've Learned Works

- Hands-on product tour approach - letting him drive the screen share
- Providing context on WHY features exist before diving into HOW
- Acknowledging his CS expertise and positioning as a partnership ('we might leverage that on our end too')
- Offering flexibility in implementation speed ('I can accelerate that as fast as we need')
- Being transparent about what's 80% ready vs. needs customization

### What to Avoid

- Don't push workflows live without his testing approval
- Don't assume generic coaching frameworks work - he needs customization for his team's methodology
- Don't overwhelm with too many workflows at once - he wants to test incrementally
- Don't treat him as just an end user - he wants to be involved in configuration

### Evolving Priorities (in order of importance)

1. Automated coaching on calls (sales and CS) - wants objective performance feedback for his reps
2. One-on-one prep workflows - needs consolidated rep performance data before coaching sessions (stats on customer interactions, best/worst calls, churn risks, renewal discussions)
3. Sentiment workflows - churn risk analysis, upsell identification, proactive deal intervention
4. Post-call summaries - both for Salesforce logging AND customer-facing recap emails
5. Product feedback capture - systematic way to collect and route feature requests from customer calls
6. Weekly team summary - digestible overview of team performance and calls requiring attention
7. Salesforce integration - contact enrichment, automated logging, field updates
8. CS platform integration - future interest in Planhat connectivity

# Key Quotes Across All Meetings

### Meeting 1 (Nov 3, 2025)

"I head up the CS team, but I also know our VP looked at the product and is interested in using it here as well."

Context: Multi-stakeholder buy-in, potential expansion beyond CS team to sales

"It'd be really nice to get, like, a weekly summary of my team and, like, okay. Here's the calls they ran, and here's the ones that you should pay attention to based off of these metrics or whatever it may be."

Context: Core use case - needs efficient way to coach team without listening to every call

"That's probably the main use case I'd use them for"

Context: Regarding one-on-one prep - Individual rep coaching sessions are his primary management activity

"I wanna be pretty involved with them"

Context: Referring to workflows - Not a hands-off manager, wants to understand and control the tools his team uses

"Yeah. It would be really nice just to go, like, just some overall stats on customer interactions. Like, here's how many external calls they had or external emails they sent. And then what calls did they talk about renewals, or what were the main like, what were the best calls? What were the worst calls? Any churn risks?"

Context: Detailed requirements for one-on-one prep workflow - wants both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights

# Relationship Intelligence

### Internal Champions/Blockers

- Allies with: VP who also evaluated the product (potential executive sponsor)
- Team size: 20 available seats during pilot (suggests decent-sized CS team)
- Met Mike at CS 100 conference at Sundance - already familiar with AskElephant brand through LinkedIn
- Initial relationship through: Ben and Dean (conference connections)

### Decision Dynamics

- Authority level: CS team leader with budget/pilot approval authority
- Buying stage: Signed 60-day pilot, actively onboarding
- Expansion potential: VP interest suggests possible sales team adoption after CS success
- Influence pattern: Wants to prove value to team first, then expand
- Technical gatekeeper needed: Salesforce admin (not Jarom) required for CRM integration

### Key Stakeholders

- Direct reports: CS reps who will use the tool daily
- Salesforce admin: Needs to connect integration
- VP: Watching pilot performance, interested in sales use cases
- AskElephant contacts: Parker Alexander (primary CS contact), Mike (sales/initial demo)

# Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 72 Hours)

1. Connect Salesforce admin temporarily to establish CRM integration
2. Add CS team members as users (up to 20 seats) to start building call library
3. Schedule end-user training for CS team (Thursday or Friday this week)
4. Build custom one-on-one prep workflow tailored to Jarom's specific requirements
5. Test and refine churn alert, product feedback, and coaching workflows in Jarom's personal Slack channels

### Follow-up Call Scheduled

- Date: January 10, 2026 at 9:30 AM MST
- Duration: 30 minutes
- Purpose: Review workflow performance, gather feedback, adjust configurations
- Agenda items: One-on-one prep workflow output review, coaching framework customization needs, team adoption feedback

### Based on Aggregate Learnings

1. Build one-on-one prep workflow with these specific elements: External call count and email volume per rep, Calls mentioning renewals, Best performing calls (positive sentiment, strong discovery, good outcomes), Worst performing calls (negative sentiment, missed opportunities, customer friction), Churn risk flags, Overall performance trends
2. Customize coaching workflow to match Brevium's CS methodology (TBD - need to ask what framework they use)
3. Create product feedback workflow that routes to appropriate Slack channel for product team visibility
4. Set up recap email workflow with two versions: Internal (Salesforce-formatted meeting summary) and External (Customer-facing next steps email)

### Watch for

- Potential concern: If workflows produce too much noise or false positives, Jarom may lose trust in the system
- Opportunity: Strong VP interest = potential to expand to sales team after CS success (revenue expansion)
- Risk: 60-day pilot timeline is short - need to deliver clear value quickly to convert to full customer
- Success signal: Jarom's willingness to be hands-on means high engagement, but also higher expectations for customization
- Team adoption: If reps don't see immediate value or find it cumbersome, Jarom may pull back

### Engagement Strategy

- Weekly check-ins during pilot phase to course-correct quickly
- Provide workflow outputs proactively so Jarom sees value without having to ask
- Offer on-site training option (they're geographically close) to deepen relationship
- Position Parker as embedded CS partner, not just support contact
- Look for opportunities to connect Jarom with other CS leaders in AskElephant customer base for peer validation

# Persona Flexibility Note

Jarom is a pure Celine persona - his entire focus is on customer success team leadership, retention, coaching, and operational efficiency. No secondary persona traits detected. He exhibits Celine's characteristic blend of: Data-driven decision making, Team enablement focus, Desire for consolidated customer context, Proactive risk management, Collaborative but autonomous working style, Technical comfort with integrated tools, and Strategic thinking about long-term team performance.

His approach to AskElephant adoption perfectly mirrors the Celine Jobs-To-Be-Done framework: consolidating customer interaction data, flagging at-risk accounts, enabling proactive coaching, and demonstrating measurable CS team impact.

# Meeting History

- **November 10, 2025** - AskElephant Pilot Sync: Progress check-in after first week of pilot. Jarom asking detailed questions about platform features, building workflows, and planning team enablement.

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 85% match with Celine (CSM)
**Secondary Traits**: Shows 30% traits of Irina (Implementation) due to hands-on technical approach

**Classification Rationale**:
Jarom exhibits strong Customer Success Manager characteristics - he's focused on team success, methodical in his adoption approach, and thinking about long-term rollout strategy. However, he shows elevated technical capabilities beyond typical CSM profile, actively building AI workflows and diving into configuration details. He's clearly acting as an internal champion, testing features thoroughly before expanding to his team and eventually the sales organization.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Consistent Patterns** (First detailed meeting):

- Methodical learner: comes prepared with specific questions
- Team-first mindset: "How do I see my entire team's meetings?"
- Test-before-deploy approach: testing workflows before team rollout
- Ownership mentality: building workflows himself vs. requesting builds

**Initial Observations**:

- Technical comfort: building AI workflows, understanding node logic
- Collaborative communication: appreciates guidance but explores independently
- Strategic thinking: planning Wednesday training, then sales team expansion

# Aggregated Insights

**Pain Points Identified**:

1. **Visibility**: Difficulty accessing team meetings in aggregate
2. **Automation**: Need for automated meeting summaries and notifications
3. **Configuration**: Workflow complexity requiring guidance
4. **Integration**: Need for Salesforce connection (not yet completed)

**Goals & Initiatives**:

1. **Immediate**: Team training scheduled for Wednesday at 11 AM
2. **Short-term**: Expand from 9 to all 20 seats after testing phase
3. **Medium-term**: Roll out to sales team if pilot succeeds
4. **Technical**: Connect Salesforce, implement customer quote generator, churn detection, and coaching workflows

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**What Works**:

- Screen-sharing walkthrough approach
- Letting him experiment with AI workflow builder
- Providing examples (BANT framework customization)
- Offering to assist with team training

**Engagement Approach**:

- Balance between empowerment and support
- Let him build, but offer to validate/optimize

# Key Quotes by Theme

**Team Enablement**:

- "I've got a training scheduled with my team to take them through this on Wednesday"
- "Last week, I kinda was like, everyone just get access and you'll learn why soon"

**Methodical Approach**:

- "My team is gonna keep testing it this week. And then I think we're gonna expand it to the sales team, assuming all goes well next week"
- "I could test this for this week, see if it's working well. And then if not [we can adjust]"

**Technical Engagement**:

- "This is so cool" (when learning about AI workflow builder)
