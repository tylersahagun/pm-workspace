Meeting summary for Nov 7, 2025 discovery call discussing Attention pain points and AskElephant pilot interest.

# Meeting History

**Meeting 1: November 7, 2025** - Discovery/Market Research Call with Tony Mickelsen

- **Context**: Tony conducting market research on RevOps challenges and competitive analysis (Attention)
- **Duration**: ~34 minutes
- **Key Topics**: Tool adoption failures, visibility gaps, organizational merger complexity
- **Outcome**: Interest in AskElephant pilot (3-5 reps), lunch meeting scheduled, BambooHR intro requested

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 85% match with **Odis (Operations)**

**Secondary Traits**: Shows elements of Roger (Revenue Leader) in strategic thinking but lacks executive authority

**Classification Rationale**:
Braydon exhibits classic Operations/RevOps challenges - fighting for visibility, battling tool adoption, managing complex CRM architecture, and lacking authority to enforce standards. His technical sophistication (understands Salesforce data models, AI prompts, integration challenges) combined with operational constraints make him a strong Odis match.

The 15% gap stems from limited executive authority and startup/scale-up context vs. enterprise operations.

# Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Initial Profile** (Meeting 1):

- Extremely transparent about internal dysfunction ("CEO sucks at putting his foot down")
- Technical and detail-oriented when discussing tools (showed Attention interface, explained data structure)
- Pragmatic about adoption challenges and cultural fit
- Solution-oriented despite organizational constraints

**Communication Approach**:

- Direct and candid about problems
- Open to sharing competitive intelligence
- Values relationship building (church connection, lunch invitation)
- Collaborative problem-solving style

# Aggregated Insights

**Pain Points (Priority Order)**:

1. **Visibility Crisis** (Primary) - "Number one issue far and away" - can't see deal progression
2. **Tool Adoption Failure** - AEs refuse to record calls despite having Attention
3. **Authority Gap** - Can influence but can't mandate or enforce consequences
4. **Leadership Vacuum** - Weak CEO and Head of Sales won't support initiatives
5. **Off-the-Books Behavior** - Reps use personal phones, avoid CRM
6. **Org Complexity** - Merger with Conservis by Jan 1st, duplicate systems
7. **Coaching Gap** - Has coaching tools but can't get adoption

**Goals (Stated & Implied)**:

- **Primary**: Improve visibility into sales activities and deal status
- **Secondary**: Drive tool adoption among resistant AE team
- **Operational**: Navigate Conservis integration (2 Salesforce instances, SalesLoft vs Outreach)
- **Aspirational**: Enable data-driven coaching (Attention features unused)
- **Personal**: Prove value despite lack of authority

**Tools Currently Used**:

- **Salesforce** - Custom structure (Company 1 Account + Opportunity per property)
- **Attention** - Competitor product with poor AE adoption
- **SalesLoft** - Sales engagement (vs. Conservis Outreach)
- **Slack** - High adoption, used for Attention AI agent ("onboard-helper")
- **Stage Marketing** - Outsourced agency (2.5 years)

**Organizational Context**:

- **Company**: Onboard (bulk Internet for apartment complexes)
- **Revenue Team**: 5 AEs, 2 BDRs (report to Braydon), 20 CS/Implementation
- **Parent Co**: Conservis (1,000+ employees, Logan UT, 25 years old)
- **Merger Date**: January 1, 2025 - sales teams combining
- **Culture**: Startup 1 Enterprise transition challenges

# Strategic Engagement Notes

**What Works With Braydon**:
 Pilot approach (low commitment, proves value)
 Focus on rep incentives vs. mandates (cultural fit)
 Technical demonstrations (he's sophisticated, appreciates details)
 Transparency about trade-offs
 Relationship building (lunch, community connections)
 Market research/mutual value exchange

**What to Avoid**:
 Assuming procurement authority (requires approval)
 Promising top-down adoption will work (he knows it won't)
 Oversimplifying organizational complexity
 Ignoring parent company constraints

**Buying Journey Status**:

- **Stage**: Late Evaluation (has competitor, dissatisfied, seeking alternatives)
- **Timeline**: Flexible ("need to talk to a couple people")
- **Budget**: Unknown - parent company procurement required
- **Authority**: Champion/Influencer (not sole decision maker)
- **Pain Level**: High (explicitly stated current tool failing)
- **Fit**: Strong product-market fit for AskElephant

**Next Steps Committed**:

1. Tony schedules lunch meeting 
2. Connect with AskElephant sales for pilot discussion 
3. Braydon provides BambooHR contact (sales ops) 
4. Pilot scope: 3-5 reps, focus on adoption metrics

# Key Quotes Collection

## On Primary Pain (Visibility)

> 
> 
> 
> "Number one issue far and away is just visibility into what's going on. Like, in a lot of it a lot of it has to do with the people and see it. And so, like, some of this can't necessarily be solved with tooling, but, like, we just have a really hard time knowing what is going on with the deal."
> 

## On Tool Adoption Challenge

> 
> 
> 
> "We have a tool that's it's a Gong competitor called Attention... They don't really record their calls, so we don't really have a ton of visibility... The adoption for attention has sucked."
> 

> 
> 
> 
> "They like call like, calling and texting from their personal cell phone and doing stuff, like, off the books type of the it's just, like, it's honestly weird. I have never worked at a place like this."
> 

## On Authority Constraints

> 
> 
> 
> "I have no authority to, like, do anything. I can't be like, oh, you're on a pip or, oh, we're you know, you got thirty days to do this or you're fired. I don't really I can't really say that."
> 

## On Leadership Issues

> 
> 
> 
> "Part of the reason our sales team is moving over to join Conservisa sales team is because our CEO sucks at putting his foot down, and our head of sales sucks at putting his foot down."
> 

## On Required Adoption Approach

> 
> 
> 
> "It's gonna have to be, like, a grassroots thing where it's, like, it has to be in the rep's own incentive. Like, if AskElephant doesn't provide each individual rep enough value, then they won't adopt it. But if it does provide them enough value and incentive, then they will."
> 

## On Current Solution Failure

> 
> 
> 
> "I'm definitely interested mainly because the attention has not panned out how we've wanted it to."
> 

> 
> 
> 
> "When they do record, it is great because then we can see some stuff... But it just hasn't been enough for them to do it."
> 

## On Organizational Complexity

> 
> 
> 
> "Ever since we got acquired, we have to go through their procurement process, and it's just a huge pain... We have two Salesforce instances. We have like, we use SalesLoft. They use Outreach... It's gonna be, honestly, a nightmare from a, like, operational perspective."
> 

## On Conservis Culture

> 
> 
> 
> "They're the largest employer in Utah... They're, like, super old school... For fifteen years plus, they built their own CRM... They will not get Slack... They are, like, old school, like, sending emails, using Google Chat."
