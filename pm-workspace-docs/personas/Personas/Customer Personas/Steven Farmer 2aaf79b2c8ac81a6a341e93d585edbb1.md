# Meeting History

**Meeting 1: November 13, 2025** - Initial Partnership Exploration

- Context: Partnership discussion between Dialog (ATS/CRM platform) and AskElephant
- Purpose: Explore integration opportunities via webhooks for CRM automation
- Outcome: Scheduled follow-up call with Dialog founder Mike for next week

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 75% match with Odis (Operations)

**Secondary Traits**: Shows 40% traits of Aaron (Account Executive) due to recruiting sales experience

**Classification Rationale**:

Steven exhibits strong Odis (Operations) characteristics through his deep focus on operational efficiency, process optimization, and tool/system thinking. His role as Head of Product at Dialog reinforces this, as he's building solutions specifically to eliminate manual work and scale solo recruiter productivity. However, he's not a pure operations persona because:

1. He maintains an active recruiting practice (SK Consulting) with 13 years of experience
2. He understands both the sales side (business development) and recruitment side of the desk
3. He has product leadership and entrepreneurial responsibilities beyond typical ops roles

The hybrid nature makes him valuable for partnership discussions as he understands both the practitioner pain points AND how to translate them into operational solutions.

# Key Quotes Collection

**On Manual Work Pain**:

"I cannot write nor type as fast as someone can talk, especially salespeople, especially salespeople that are good, especially salespeople that do their shit. I can't keep up. So while I'm trying to keep up with her typing or I'm not listening."

**On AI Adoption**:

"I tell everyone, I don't think recruiters are getting replaced anytime soon. What I do the recruiters that will get replaced are the ones that not that do not completely embrace how AI can allow"

**On Scale Goals**:

"The goal of dialogue is before you have to hire anyone else, a sourcer, which which goes out and gets the candidates and then the recruiter actually talks to them...before you go out and get a salesperson to go out and get the business and give away half the pie, you can get to a pretty high number by yourself."

**On Notetaker Value**:

"now with the notetaker, it's like, tell me all the things. Let me sit back literally and ask"

**On Recruiting Model**:

"recruiting is basically a two desk model. The one half of the desk is the sales and business development that has to go out and get the company that's hiring. Then the other end of the desk has to go out and get the candidate."

**On CRM Usage Reality**:

"some will tell you it ain't fifty fifty. A solo recruiter is in that CRM looking for clients more than they are going to get the candidate, to be honest."
