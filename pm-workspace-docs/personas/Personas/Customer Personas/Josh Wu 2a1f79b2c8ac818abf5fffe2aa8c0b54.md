# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 4, 2025 - Initial discovery call with AskElephant for rebrand project

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Aaron (Strategic Buyer) with Celine (Solution-Focused Pragmatist) traits

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Presented as Aaron based on methodical, process-oriented approach to scoping and proposal development

**Why this classification**:
Josh demonstrates classic Aaron characteristics through his structured, methodical approach to the sales conversation. He systematically gathered requirements, took detailed notes, and outlined a clear process for next steps ("pull together some things," "scope a little bit more," "come with a straw man"). His request for curated examples "similar to what you're looking for" and focus on phased approach shows risk mitigation and strategic thinking. He's budget-aware without being mentioned explicitly, quickly understanding Tony's request for two proposal sizes. His timeline management ("Let me be aggressive here. How about Friday?") shows process discipline. Secondary Celine traits emerge in his flexibility ("whichever you prefer") and practical problem-solving around Framer vs. WordPress/Webflow.

# Aggregated Behavioral Insights

**Consistent Patterns Across Meetings:**

- Highly organized and process-driven in sales approach
- Takes comprehensive notes during conversations
- Focuses on understanding full scope before proposing solutions
- Values showing relevant examples to build credibility
- Methodical in breaking down complex projects into phases

**Communication Preferences:**

- Prefers structured follow-up with concrete deliverables
- Uses visual aids (shared screen to show website portfolio)
- Likes to present options with clear trade-offs
- Central Time (Chicago) - good availability on Fridays

# Strategic Engagement Playbook (Updated)

**Current Stage**: Active Prospect - Initial Discovery Complete

**What We've Learned Works:**

- Being transparent about budget constraints - Josh immediately adapted to request for two proposal sizes
- Showing internal design capabilities and flexibility - Josh appreciated that AskElephant has UX designer in-house
- Direct qualification questions - Tony's "yes/no" format worked well to quickly establish fit
- Providing context about stage and goals - Josh used the Series A context to understand urgency and scope

**What to Avoid:**

- Rushing the process - Josh wants to bring curated examples and detailed proposals
- Assuming platform limitations - He's flexible on tech stack (Framer, WordPress, Webflow, Figma)
- One-size-fits-all proposals - He recognized need for multiple options based on budget

**Evolving Priorities:**

1. Meeting 1 Priority: Understand scope, establish fit, set clear next steps with proposal options

# Key Quotes Across All Meetings

**Meeting 1**: "So we only build what we work. We put together just the folks who need it when you need it and not more than that."
Context: Josh emphasized Rally's flexible staffing model as a key differentiator, directly addressing Tony's budget sensitivity

**Meeting 1**: "I can come with a straw man of, hey. This is what I think I heard, and we can dissect that to see if it makes sense to figure out timing and deliverables, of course, and also pricing cost."
Context: Shows Josh's collaborative, iterative approach - he wants Tony's input rather than presenting a take-it-or-leave-it proposal

**Meeting 1**: "We only really play in the senior and principal space where, right, a lot of our projects are that the branding strategy and all that."
Context: Establishing credibility and quality standards - Rally doesn't use junior designers, which aligns with AskElephant's Series A maturity needs

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions/Blockers:**

- Direct relationship with: Tony Mickelsen (VP of Marketing)
- Tony mentioned existing resources: UX designer in-house, trusted part-time designer, messaging consultant
- Potential competition: Other vendors Tony is talking to this week, existing video production quotes

**Decision Dynamics:**

- Tony has budget authority but is constrained - needs options
- Decision timeline: End of next week (wants to decide by ~November 14-15)
- Tony is gathering multiple quotes and having second conversations
- Tony values guidance and wants to be challenged on assumptions

**Business Context:**

- AskElephant raised seed funding months ago, preparing for Series A
- Investor feedback: Product ahead of marketing
- Current site built in weekend, acknowledged as inadequate
- Millions in ARR but 100% sales-driven (no marketing engine)
- Strong LinkedIn/social selling presence but weak brand perception

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on aggregate learnings:**

1. **Friday follow-up meeting (11:30 AM Central)**: Josh will bring 2-3 curated examples from Rally portfolio, particularly AI B2B companies (Roger, Mandolin, Engaging AI mentioned)
2. **Provide two proposal options**:
    - Option A: Full-service (Rally handles strategy + execution)
    - Option B: Strategy-only (Rally guides, AskElephant resources execute)
3. **Phased approach**: Logo/brand identity → Messaging strategy → Website design → Q1 brand launch
4. **Emphasize Rally's AI client experience**: Multiple AI companies in portfolio aligns with AskElephant's market

**Watch for:**

- Tony's decision by end of next week - this is a short sales cycle
- Competition from other agencies Tony is evaluating
- Budget constraints may push toward Option B (strategy-only)
- Tony mentioned existing video quotes - Rally may not get all scope elements
- Tony wants to be challenged but also needs guidance - balance expertise with collaboration

**Competitive Positioning:**

- Strength: Flexible staffing model fits Tony's budget sensitivity
- Strength: AI client portfolio demonstrates relevant experience
- Strength: Senior/principal-only team aligns with Series A maturity needs
- Risk: AskElephant has some internal design resources that could reduce Rally's scope
- Risk: Tony is price shopping with multiple vendors

# Persona Flexibility Note

Josh Wu exhibits Aaron (Strategic Buyer) as his dominant type - methodical, process-oriented, risk-averse through structured approach. He shows Celine (Solution-Focused Pragmatist) traits when problem-solving around technical constraints (Framer vs. WordPress/Webflow) and flexible team configuration. Approach with Aaron strategies (detailed proposals, phased approach, curated examples, clear processes) but be ready to pivot to Celine tactics (flexible solutions, practical problem-solving) when discussing technical implementation or resource constraints. His consultative selling style suggests he values collaborative decision-making over hard closes.

**Meeting Context & Deliverables Discussed:**

- Logo redesign (addressing previous Fiverr logo issue)
- Brand color palette update (currently black/blue, considering changes)
- Messaging hierarchy and brand architecture
- Visual brand guidelines (color, typography, standards)
- Website overhaul (most messaging changing, not just facelift)
- Potential Q1 2025 brand launch campaign
- Sales enablement materials
- Product cohesion (though AskElephant has internal UX for product itself)

**Technical Details:**

- AskElephant uses Framer (not WordPress/Webflow)
- Current site designed in Figma, built in Framer by internal UX designer
- Rally can work in Figma and hand off, or prototype in Framer
- Rally builds in WordPress/Webflow typically but adaptable

**Rally Design Background:**

- Chicago-based design shop
- Two service areas: Product design (UX for apps) and Visual design (branding, websites, marketing)
- Flexible staffing model - only bring in resources needed per phase
- Senior/principal designers only (no junior level)
- Portfolio includes multiple AI companies: Roger (consumer), Mandolin (healthcare AI), Engaging AI (agent configuration platform)
- 50/50 split B2B vs consumer work
- Can build and launch websites
- In-house copywriters available

## Meeting History

**Meeting 2: November 7, 2025 - Portfolio Presentation & Proposal Discussion**

Josh presented Rally Design's full portfolio deck including:

- Brand strategy work (Engagy AI chatbot tool case study)
- Visual design examples (Mandolin healthcare AI, Falconer developer tool, Yield fintech)
- UX design capabilities (Essential financial reporting tool)
- Logo design portfolio
- Motion graphics capabilities

**Key Discussion Points:**

- Pricing: $135/hr (brand strategist) to$ 165/hr (design principle)
- Scope: 40-60 hours for brand strategy phase (3-4 weeks)
- Timeline: Aaron (brand strategist) can start before Thanksgiving or early December
- Competition: Tony evaluating Rally vs Focus Lab (same $165/hr rate, but can't start designers until January)
- Decision factors: Team chemistry, cultural fit, timeline advantage

**Josh's Sales Approach:**

- Consultative discovery: "How does AskElephant reduce overwhelm?"
- Active listening to Tony's positioning insights (3 types of AI overwhelm)
- Flexible scoping: Modular a la carte approach vs. full engagement
- Chemistry-first: Proposed meetings with Aaron and designer before commitment

**Tony's Strategic Insights Shared:**

- Differentiation strategy: Focus on business outcomes vs. competitor's "AI shiny toy" messaging
- Target audience pain: AI overwhelm (job security fears, adoption curve, data overload)
- Positioning: "Where they zig, we'll zag" - outcomes over features
- Brand direction: Calming approach to combat complexity (parallel to Engagy case study)

**Josh's Current Workflow (Pain Points Revealed):**

- Fathom 1 OneNote (manual copy-paste) 1 Folk CRM
- Lacks automated workflows for meeting insights
- Interested in AskElephant's "human-in-the-loop" approval feature
- Sees value in auto-generated creative briefs sent to Asana

**Next Steps Agreed:**

- Schedule meeting with Aaron (brand strategist) using Tony's Calendly
- Follow-up meeting with designer after Aaron chemistry check
- Target December start if chemistry aligns
- Tony to make final vendor decision soon (Series A fundraising timeline)
- Meeting 3: 2025-11-11 - Brand strategy discovery session with Tony Mickelsen and Erin Prus. Josh facilitated conversation about AskElephant's brand refresh, competitor positioning, and strategic differentiation. Introduced Erin as brand strategist to collaborate on repositioning beyond "AI notetaker" perception. Demonstrated collaborative agency approach.
