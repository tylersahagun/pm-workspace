# Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: November 11, 2025 - CSM Introduction call with Erika (CSM) and Jazz (AI Strategist). Technical difficulties prevented full conversation. John Karlo mentioned this was a continuation of previous AI-focused call with Jazz, now including Holly (Head of Sales) for her separate sales needs.

# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence**: 65% match with Odis (Operations)
**Secondary Traits**: May show traits of Irina (Implementation) given AI focus - need more data

**Classification Rationale**:
John Karlo demonstrates coordination and technical implementation focus. He's been working with the AI strategist on implementation and now brings in sales leadership, suggesting an operational/coordination role. However, limited conversation due to technical issues means confidence is moderate. Need additional meetings to validate.

**Evolution Observed**:

- Initially: Solo focus on AI implementation (previous call with Jazz)
