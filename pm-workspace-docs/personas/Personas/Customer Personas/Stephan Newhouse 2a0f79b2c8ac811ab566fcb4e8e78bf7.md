# Key Quotes from Meeting 1

"It's not the mission accomplished banner when you ship. It's much more about what was the original thesis, what relevant business metric is this supposed to drive. Is it driving it?"

"To be fully candid, it's been exciting and fun, but it's extremely, extremely high risk at this point."

"VST - vision strategy tactics. You can trace a line from the high level vision down to the tactical user stories."
