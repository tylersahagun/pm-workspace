# Persona Validation Summary

**Match Confidence:** 85% match with **Roger (Revenue Leader)Secondary Traits:** Shows 30% traits of Aaron (AE) due to tactical operational focus

2. **Closed-Lost Deal Re-engagement Workflow** (mentioned 3 times)
    - Calls them "ODOs" (Old Deal Outreaches) - "where most of the revenue comes from"
    - "We can't get any of that information into Outreach from HubSpot"

    - No visibility into call history or opportunity quality
3. **CRM Hygiene Challenges** (mentioned 2 times)
    - "On the SDR front, it's horrible. I mean, it's not heinous, but it's definitely not great."
    - Information scattered across multiple systems
4. **AE to CS Handoff Context Loss** (mentioned 2 times)
    - "That AE to CS handoff is huge because all of that can get lost in an instant. Nobody's really looking at it."

    - Currently working on "aligning our ICP right now and dwindling it down"
    - Wants to analyze: "Why are CSOs buying UpGuard?"

# Observed Goals

    - Reached out to Adia specifically for comp structure advice
    - 12-15 touchpoints per SDR to book meeting
2. **Better Closed-Lost Re-engagement**
    - Late-stage pipeline deals that died need better revival process
    - Need tiering system for closed-lost opportunities
    - Want seamless data flow from HubSpot to Outreach
3. **ICP Refinement**
    - "Aligning our ICP right now and dwindling it down"
    - Target: CSOs, CIOs, InfoSec Managers/Directors
    - "CSO is our golden nugget for bookings"
4. **Tool Consolidation for 2026**
    - Planning phase for 2026 initiatives
    - Tool freeze until January (budget conscious)
    - Recently removed ZoomInfo, building internal tool
5. **Cross-functional Visibility**

# Tech Stack & Tools

**Currently Using:**

- **CRM:** HubSpot (no Salesforce)
- **Sales Engagement:** Outreach (SDRs live here)
- **Call Recording:** Gong (AEs use heavily, SDRs rarely)
- **Dialer:** Nooks (purchased ~6 months ago, has AI insights)
- **Sales Nav:** SalesNav
- **Removed:** ZoomInfo (cost cutting, building internal replacement)

**Tool Usage Patterns:**

- SDRs: Live in Outreach & Nooks, rarely use HubSpot or Gong
- AEs: Live in HubSpot & Gong, all activity logged through Gong
- ~200 tools total with limited integration

**Critical Integration Requirement:**

- **Outreach integration is mandatory for SDR adoption**
- "If there's an Outreach integration... that's the big issue... the SDRs don't really live in HubSpot. They live in Outreach and they live in Nooks."

    - Payton will share demo recording and materials
2. **SVP of Global Sales** (unnamed)
    - Recently promoted to SVP
    - "Still in the weeds on everything the SDRs do"
    - Previously receptive: "When I sent him the ICP stuff from AskElephant... he was like, meet with her now"
    - Has meeting with him regularly

**Buying Timeline:**

- **Tool freeze until January 2026** (hard constraint)
- Currently in evaluation/shopping phase

# Strategic Engagement Notes

## ✅ What Works (Proven)

1. **Focus on AE/CS value over SDR value**
    - They recently invested in SDR tools (Nooks)
    - AE-CS handoff is acknowledged major pain point
    - More budget/interest in this area
2. **Provide shareable materials for internal championing**
    - Wants to forward demo recording
    - Interested in AI agents examples page
    - Needs ammunition for Sarah and SVP conversations
3. **Acknowledge their constraints empathetically**
    - Tool proliferation challenges
    - Budget freeze realities
    - Integration complexities
4. **Specific, tactical demonstrations**
    - Show exact workflows (HubSpot automation, deal creation)
    - Answer specific questions (ICP scoring, closed-lost analysis)
    - Avoid generic pitches
5. **Respect timing and process**
    - January 2026 timeline is real
    - Multi-stakeholder approval needed
    - Will follow their internal process

## ❌ What Doesn't Work (To Avoid)

1. **Don't position as "just another tool"**
    - They're trying to consolidate, not add
    - Emphasize replacement/integration capability
2. **Don't oversell SDR use case**
    - Nooks recently purchased
    - Many internal agent projects
    - Wait for Outreach integration
3. **Don't expect immediate decisions**
    - Budget freeze until January is firm
    - Needs multi-stakeholder buy-in
    - Q1 2026 realistic timeline
4. **Don't bypass internal champions**
    - Sarah and SVP must be involved
    - Payton's influence depends on their support
    - Let Payton control internal narrative
5. **Don't ignore technical requirements**
    - Outreach integration is critical
    - ICP scoring must work as demonstrated
    - Tool must integrate with existing stack

# Next Steps & Follow-up

**Immediate Actions (Payton's side):**

1. Share demo recording with Sarah (Head of Sales Americas)
2. Send AI agents examples page to Sarah and SVP
3. Have internal discussions with leadership

## On Interest Level

**By Department:**

> 
> "I think for the business as a whole in terms of CSAE, everybody, and using it within a HubSpot, I'd say probably, like, a seven.

But I think for, like, AECS, like, that's I could see where it would be a huge advantage."
> 

**On ICP Scoring:**

> 
> 
> 
> "We're aligning our ICP right now and, like, dwindling it down, like, theories, certain specific qualifications, titles, personas, you name it. Is there a way with this if I wanted to take every call in our database and go, why are CSOs buying UpGuard?"

## On Critical Requirements

**Outreach Integration:**
