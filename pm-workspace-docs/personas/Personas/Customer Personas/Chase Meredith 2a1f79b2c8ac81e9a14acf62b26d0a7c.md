# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 3, 2025 - AskElephant Product Onboarding

# Persona Assessment

**Current Assessment**: Roger (Revenue-focused founder)

**Why this classification**: Chase is a pre-seed startup founder building Replay, an AI role-play platform for sales training. His engagement during onboarding revealed clear revenue-focused priorities: immediately interested in LinkedIn post generator for brand visibility and lead generation, excited about customer quote workflows to capture social proof, questions centered on practical ROI and workflows that drive business outcomes. Connected with Woody previously and has been following AskElephant's growth journey. Located in Utah, operating as solo founder taking all customer calls currently. Despite his technical curiosity, his primary lens is revenue and growth.

# Initial Behavioral Insights

**First Impression Patterns:**

- Highly self-sufficient: Explored product extensively before onboarding, already set up integrations
- Pragmatic and considerate: Self-aware about being a "really small customer"
- Technically literate but not technical-first: Understands AI but more interested in business applications
- Growth-minded with constraints: Wants to maximize value but conscious of resource limitations

**Communication Style:** Collaborative and appreciative tone, direct about needs and priorities, quick to adapt and problem-solve, comfortable saying "no" to features that aren't priority

**Decision-Making Approach:** Fast evaluator, value-focused, willing to be beta tester, makes decisions independently as solo founder

# Strategic Engagement Playbook

**Current Stage**: New Customer - Onboarding Complete

**Key Priorities:**

1. Importing historical calls: ~200 calls from Fireflies
2. Notion workflow: Meeting data flowing into Notion
3. Top use cases: LinkedIn post generator, customer quotes, meeting summaries

**What Resonates:** Workflow automation, content generation for marketing, social proof capture, integration capabilities, practical demonstrations

**What to Avoid:** Overcomplicated setups, features requiring team collaboration, high-touch support expectations

# Key Quotes

**Meeting 1 (Nov 3, 2025)**: "Utah based founder of a small pre seed start up. We make AI role plays for sales training. I've been connected with Woody for a long time." - Context: Reveals long-term relationship building approach

"I wouldn't prioritize it if I were you guys. I'm, like, a really, really small customer." - Context: Self-aware, considerate, doesn't expect white-glove treatment

"I like the quote generator. I like the post generator." - Context: Clear preference for marketing/revenue-enabling workflows

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions:** Erika Vasquez (CSM handling onboarding), Woody (long-time connection), Tyler (integrations manager for Fireflies import and Notion workflow)

**Decision Dynamics:** Complete authority as solo founder, pre-seed stage budget considerations, hands-on evaluation approach, 3 prior calls with Woody

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Immediate Actions:**

1. Tyler to assess Fireflies import (200 calls)
2. Build Notion workflow matching Fireflies format
3. Monitor LinkedIn post generator for qualifying calls

**Engagement Strategy:** Low-touch high-value approach, async communication focus, leverage for beta testing, share solo founder best practices

**Growth Opportunities:** Team collaboration features when he scales, sales coaching positioning when hiring, potential partnership opportunity, customer success story potential

**Watch For:** Call volume increasing, team expansion, sales coaching feature requests, advocacy potential

# Additional Context

**Current Tool Stack:** Fireflies (current), Fathom (previous), Slack (connected), Notion (wants integration)

**Geographic/Timing:** Utah location (MST timezone), founder schedule flexible but busy
