Validation Notes: Ken manages a team that handles escalations and account reviews at PestShare. His team engages directly with service providers via phone/Zoom calls. Currently manually transferring information from HubSpot and calls to various internal stakeholders. Not yet leveraging AskElephant workflows despite team needs. Strong candidate for automation - handles vendor relationships, escalations, and feedback routing to product team.
