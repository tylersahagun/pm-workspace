Key Quotes: "We have no data on it [demos]. We have some robot data. We have whatever feedback that the sales guys there to write in HubSpot, but it's so we were thinking, okay. If we could record it."

"These guys, they drive, like, five hours to go to a demo. They do a demo. They drive two other hours to go to another demo, then they drive home. So they have extremely long days. Don't they they're not behind a computer much."

"That's why we want to make a trial to show people, like so that they don't start complaining. It's just that's gonna fucking help you. Just do it."

His focus is on capturing missing data from in-person demos to improve coaching, follow-up, and automation. Strong emphasis on adoption challenges with field sales teams who are road warriors. Shows 75% match with Odis persona but with more hands-on operational involvement and international complexity.
