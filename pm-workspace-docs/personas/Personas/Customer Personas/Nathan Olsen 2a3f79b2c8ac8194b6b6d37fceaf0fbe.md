Key Quotes: One thing that I noticed with this, I've just been messing with it that I think is really cool, is I've gotten a lot of questions from customers just like what our top automations are for their specific event. And so I looked up like, it just asked the top automations for trampoline parks and then one for tours companies, and it gave, like, two completely different answers. So I think that's, like, a really cool use case for it.

Can this pull from our calls with our customers?
