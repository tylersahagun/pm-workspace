# Meeting History

- Meeting 1: November 3, 2025 - Initial AskElephant demo and discovery call

# Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: Roger (Revenue Leader) with Aaron (Sales) traits

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Presents as founder wearing the CRO/sales hat - classic Roger persona with hands-on Aaron execution responsibilities

**Why this classification**:
Jason is a co-founder at Braided who owns the revenue/sales function. While he has the strategic mindset and concerns of a Roger (Revenue Leader focused on alignment, adoption, ROI, and business impact), he's also in the trenches doing the selling work like Aaron. His statement "Guy and I are the founders of Braided, and Braided is extremely personal to me" shows the deep strategic investment typical of Roger. His interest in pipeline management, AI-calculated deal probability, and how the tool impacts business outcomes are all Roger indicators. However, his active participation in sales calls and focus on practical sales-to-engineering handoffs shows Aaron's tactical execution mindset.

**Evolving Priorities:**

1. Meeting 1 Priority: Understanding if AskElephant can serve both sales (him) and engineering (Guy) needs
2. Meeting 1 Priority: Ensuring smooth handoffs between sales and engineering
3. Meeting 1 Priority: Tool adoption and prompt library strategy

# Key Quotes Across All Meetings

**Meeting 1**: "Guy and I are the founders of Braided, and Braided is extremely personal to me that AI is the power of it in in something so close to me is awesome, yet scary at the same time."
Context: Shows the emotional investment and thoughtful approach to AI adoption - wants to harness power but do it right

**Meeting 1**: "I think it's always always good to see it, particularly from from the perspective that that you can bring to it."
Context: Values expert guidance and consultative selling approach

**Meeting 1**: "We've been using ReadAI, which, you know, is a step up from nothing at all or just, you know, old fashioned. Right. But this seems to to level it up quite a bit."
Context: Already has a point of comparison, looking for meaningful upgrade, not just another tool

# Relationship Intelligence

**Internal Champions/Blockers:**

- Co-founder with Guy Gavergun (engineering) - shared decision-making
- Works closely with Ben Dittman (consultant/advisor who recommended AskElephant)
- Ben's positive experience with AskElephant significantly influenced the decision

**Decision Dynamics:**

- Authority level: Final decision-maker alongside Guy
- Key influencers: Ben Dittman's recommendation was crucial
- Budget control: Direct control
- Decision style: Collaborative with Guy, wants both sides to see value

# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Based on aggregate learnings:**

1. Send pilot agreement promptly - Jason and Guy are ready to move forward
2. During onboarding, focus heavily on sales-to-engineering handoff workflows as this is their primary use case
3. Work with them to build custom prompts around their specific workflow needs
4. Schedule regular check-ins during pilot to demonstrate adoption progress
5. Connect them with Parker for technical implementation support

**Watch for:**

- Adoption metrics during pilot - Jason specifically mentioned this as key concern
- Guy's satisfaction with technical use cases - his buy-in is crucial
- Opportunities to expand to Laurent (contractor joining engineering team)
- Potential to expand into their client work (mentioned API partnerships)

**Opportunity:**

- If Braided finds success, they could become a case study for small founder-led teams
- Ben's consulting work could lead to more referrals
- Their focus on AI and workflows aligns perfectly with AskElephant's value prop

# Persona Flexibility Note

Jason exhibits Roger (Revenue Leader) as his dominant type but shows strong Aaron (Sales) traits when executing day-to-day sales activities. He's a founder who must wear multiple hats. Approach with Roger-level strategic discussions about business impact and ROI, but be ready to pivot to Aaron-level tactical execution details when discussing specific sales workflows and handoffs. He values both the strategic vision AND the practical implementation.
