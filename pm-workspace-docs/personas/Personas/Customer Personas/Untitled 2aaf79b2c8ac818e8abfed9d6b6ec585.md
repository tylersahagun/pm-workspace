**Meeting Details**

- Date: November 13, 2025
- Participants: Mike Canova (AskElephant), Spencer Vail, Sarah Whitcomb, Scott Crandall (PDQ)
- Meeting Type: Follow-up demo call

**Summary**
This meeting focused on implementation and technical evaluation rather than business outcomes. PDQ is a prospect in the evaluation phase, not yet a customer using AskElephant.

**Topics Discussed:**

- Salesforce integration requirements and data mapping concerns
- Workflow automation demonstration (MEDIC coaching, closed loss analysis)
- Implementation lift and RevOps considerations
- Pilot program structure with 26 sales reps
- Pricing discussions and timeline (targeting December close for January rollout)
- Competitive evaluation (Fireflies also being considered)

**Note:** This meeting focused on product demonstration, technical implementation details, and deal structure but did not include specific business outcomes from using AskElephant, as PDQ has not yet implemented the platform.
