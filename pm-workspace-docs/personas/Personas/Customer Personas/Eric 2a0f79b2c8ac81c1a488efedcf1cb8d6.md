# Eric

AE Contact: Peter Belliston
Company: WeAssist
Email: eric@weassist.io
Persona: Irina (https://www.notion.so/Irina-27ff79b2c8ac80d6876fef833b5e3799?pvs=21)

Technical Lead/Automation Specialist presenting as Irina persona (implementation-focused). Manages complex n8n workflows integrating Fireflies, Google Drive, Zoom, and Slack for 4 recruiters. Current technical stack oversight: n8n cloud ($50/mo), self-hosted n8n ($40-80/mo varying), chatbots for HR and client communication, backend automations for proprietary software. Technical validation role in purchase decisions - Reef relies on Eric to confirm technical feasibility. Gave up on Fireflies for Zoom integration, now uses Tactic for browser-based recording. Impressed by AskElephant's straightforward workflow configuration vs. complex n8n setup. Key quote: "It's a combination of different tools in just one platform. Instead of using n8n at the back, I think it's already in here. Easier to navigate." Validated that AskElephant can replace meeting-related n8n workflows while maintaining backend automations in n8n for software/chatbots.

## Meeting History

- **Meeting 1**: November 3, 2025 - AskElephant Product Demo (Technical Validation)

## Persona Evolution

**Current Assessment**: **Irina (Implementation)**

**Persona Journey**:

- Meeting 1: Classic Irina persona - technical implementer evaluating system architecture and integration feasibility

**Why this classification**:
Eric is a textbook Irina - the technical lead responsible for complex automation infrastructure, integration architecture, and backend systems. He manages n8n workflows, chatbots, API integrations, and custom automation for WeAssist's recruitment operations. He's the person Reef turns to for technical validation ("Eric, Kate, step in") and feasibility assessment. His immediate response to AskElephant was analytical - comparing it to current n8n architecture and assessing migration complexity. He's also personally experiencing Fireflies pain points (switched to Tactic for browser-based recording), making him both evaluator and end-user.

## Aggregated Behavioral Insights

### Consistent Patterns:

- **Technical Validator**: Reef relies on Eric to confirm technical feasibility before committing
- **System Architect**: Designed and maintains complex multi-tool automation workflows
- **Integration Expert**: Manages APIs, webhooks, n8n, chatbots across multiple platforms
- **Problem-Solver Mindset**: Found workaround (Tactic) when Fireflies failed for Zoom integration
- **Analytical Evaluator**: Immediately compared AskElephant to n8n architecture and workflow complexity
- **Pragmatic about Trade-offs**: Recognizes some backend automations must stay in n8n while meetings can migrate

### Technical Expertise Areas:

- n8n workflow design and management (cloud + self-hosted)
- API integrations (Fireflies, Google Drive, Zoom, Slack)
- Chatbot development and deployment (HR, client communication)
- Backend automation for proprietary software
- Data pipeline architecture
- Meeting recording and transcription workflows

### Communication Preferences:

## Persona Flexibility Note

Eric is pure **Irina (Implementation)** - technical, systematic, focused on architecture and integration feasibility. He evaluates tools through the lens of "Can I build with this? Does it integrate? Will it scale?"

**Engagement Strategy**:

- Lead with technical architecture and integration capabilities
- Provide detailed documentation and API access
- Show workflow builder flexibility
- Acknowledge what AskElephant CAN'T do (backend automations) to build trust
- Position as complement to (not replacement for) his broader technical infrastructure
- Involve him in beta testing new integrations (ClickUp, GoHighLevel)

Eric will champion AskElephant if he experiences:

1. Dramatically simpler workflow configuration
2. Rock-solid integrations
3. Elimination of Fireflies pain points
4. Preserved ability to customize via webhooks/n8n when needed
