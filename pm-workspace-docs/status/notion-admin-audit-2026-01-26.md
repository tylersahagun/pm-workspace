| Settings Redesign | Build | Add Linear project URL |
| Rep Workspace | Build | Add Linear project URL |

### 🟡 Medium Priority: Build/Test WITHOUT GTM/Launch Plan (4)

## Launch Planning Database

**Total:** 43 launches
**By Status:**
- Done: 12 (28%)
- In Progress: 5 (12%)
- Not Started: 26 (60%)

### 🔴 High Priority: Overdue Launches (14)

Past due date but not marked Done:

| Launch | End Date | Status | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| Meeting Privacy Agent | 2026-01-20 | In progress | **Active - update date or complete** |
| Knowledge Base | 2025-12-19 | In progress | Update status or reschedule |

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Today)

1. **Update Meeting Privacy Agent** - Overdue P1, decide: complete or reschedule

5. **Add Launch Tier** to high-priority launches missing it

### Ongoing

6. **Run `/notion-admin sync-gtm`** to connect projects with GTM content
