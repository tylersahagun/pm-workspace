# Development Pipeline Integration Audit

**Generated:** 2026-01-23 20:00
**Type:** Full System Test & Gap Analysis

## Executive Summary

| Category | Status | Score |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Linear Sync | ⚠️ Partial | 40% |
| GitHub Sync | ❌ Not Working | 10% |
| Initiative Mapping | ❌ Misaligned | 30% |
| Overall System | ⚠️ Needs Work | 25% |

**Bottom Line:** The framework is in place, but **critical mapping misalignment** between PM initiatives and engineering's actual Linear projects makes the system ineffective. GitHub integration requires engineering process changes that haven't been adopted.

### 3. Initiative Mapping Analysis

#### Our Mapped Initiatives vs. Reality

| PM Initiative | Mapped To Linear Project | Active Issues | Match? |
|---------------|-------------------------|---------------|--------|
| internal-search | Search & Discovery | **0** | ❌ Wrong project |
| hubspot-agent-config-ui | HubSpot Integration | ~5 | ⚠️ Partial |
| universal-signal-tables | Universal Signals | **1** | ⚠️ Stale |
| call-import-engine | Call & Data Imports | ~3 | ✅ Valid |
| crm-exp-ete | CRM Agent Upgrades | ~10 | ✅ Valid |
| admin-onboarding | Admin Onboarding | ~3 | ✅ Valid |
| settings-redesign | Workspace Settings | ~5 | ⚠️ Partial |

#### Linear Projects WITH Active Work But NO Initiative

| Linear Project | Active Issues | Assignees | Status |
|----------------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| **Global Chat** | 10+ | Dylan, Skylar, Bryan | 🔴 NOT MAPPED |
| **Engagement Capture** | 5+ | Eduardo | 🔴 NOT MAPPED |
| **SSO & User Provisioning** | 5+ | Kaden | 🔴 NOT MAPPED |
| **(No Project)** | ~11 | Various | 🔴 UNTRACKABLE |

**Critical Finding:** The most active engineering work (Global Chat) has **no corresponding PM initiative**.

---

## Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps

#### 1. Initiative ↔ Linear Project Mismatch (SEVERITY: HIGH)

**Problem:** We mapped PM initiatives to Linear projects that don't match where engineers actually track work.

**Evidence:**
- `internal-search` → "Search & Discovery" has 0 active issues
- Actual search/chat work is in "Global Chat" project (05066db9)
- We don't have a "Global Chat" initiative

**Impact:** Cannot track what engineering is actually building

**Fix:** 
1. Create new initiative: `global-chat` mapped to project `05066db9-89d7-432c-bffd-234ca92af024`
2. Consider merging `internal-search` into it
3. Audit all mappings against active Linear projects

#### 2. Low Project Assignment Rate (SEVERITY: HIGH)

**Problem:** Engineers don't consistently assign issues to Linear projects.

**Evidence:**
- Only 21% of in-progress issues have project assignments
- Most work happens without project context

**Impact:** Even with correct mappings, most work is invisible

**Fix:** 
1. Short-term: Use team + label heuristics for grouping
2. Medium-term: Work with engineering to improve project hygiene
3. Long-term: Consider Linear project as optional, use labels/milestones instead

#### 3. GitHub Label Convention Not Adopted (SEVERITY: MEDIUM)

**Problem:** Engineers aren't using `initiative:*` labels on PRs.

**Evidence:**
- 0% adoption after implementation
- No communication to engineering team

**Impact:** Cannot track shipped work by initiative

**Fix:**
1. **Alternative approach:** Use Linear issue ID in branch names to reverse-lookup
   - Branch `ASK-4591-*` → Linear issue ASK-4591 → Project → Initiative
   - This requires NO process changes from engineering
2. Add label automation via GitHub Actions
3. Or accept low mapping rate and focus on other metrics

#### 4. Branch Naming Mismatch (SEVERITY: LOW)

**Problem:** Engineers use `user/feature` or `ASK-XXXX-*` patterns, not `feat/initiative-*`.

**Evidence:**
- 0 branches match our convention
- Existing pattern (`ASK-XXXX-*`) actually contains useful data

**Impact:** Cannot use branch prefix matching

**Fix:**
- **Use what exists:** Parse `ASK-XXXX` from branch names and resolve via Linear API
- This is more reliable than asking engineers to change behavior

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Fix Internal Search Mapping**
   ```
   Current: internal-search → Search & Discovery (aa8ce4dd)
   Should be: internal-search → Global Chat (05066db9)
   ```

2. **Create Missing Initiative**
   - Create `global-chat` initiative
   - Link to Linear project: `05066db9-89d7-432c-bffd-234ca92af024`
   - Map existing `internal-search` research to it

3. **Update Sync Strategy**
   - Accept that most issues won't have projects
   - Build "unlinked work" as a visible category
   - Use Linear issue references in branches for reverse mapping

### Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks)

4. **Add Reverse Mapping Logic**
   - Parse `ASK-XXXX` from branch names
   - Call Linear API to get project
   - Auto-associate PRs with initiatives

5. **Simplify GitHub Requirements**
   - Remove `initiative:*` label requirement (low adoption)
   - Focus on automated mapping via Linear refs
   - Keep branch prefix as optional enhancement

6. **Communicate with Engineering**
   - Don't mandate new processes
   - Ask for feedback on what they'd actually use
   - Consider their existing workflows

### Medium-Term (Next Month)

7. **Add Visibility Dashboard**
   - Show work by initiative (where mapped)
   - Show unlinked work (majority of activity)
   - Track mapping coverage over time

8. **Automate Status Generation**
   - GitHub Action to run `/sync-dev` daily
   - Post to Slack or save to status folder
   - No manual invocation required

## Revised Architecture
