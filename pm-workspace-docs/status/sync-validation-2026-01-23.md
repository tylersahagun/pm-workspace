## 6. Data Quality Assessment

### \_meta.json Completeness

| Initiative              | linear_project_id | notion_project_id | github_labels | Status            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| internal-search         | ✅                | ❌                | ✅            | Needs Notion sync |
| crm-exp-ete             | ✅                | ❌                | ✅            | Needs Notion sync |
| rep-workspace           | ✅                | ❌                | ✅            | Needs Notion sync |
| admin-onboarding        | ✅                | ❌                | ✅            | Needs Notion sync |
| call-import-engine      | ✅                | ❌                | ✅            | Needs Notion sync |
| universal-signal-tables | ✅                | ❌                | ✅            | Needs Notion sync |

### Recommended Actions

1. **Run Notion → Initiative mapping** to populate `notion_project_id` fields
2. **Resolve phase discrepancy** for crm-exp-ete (Discovery vs Build)
3. **Review unmapped Linear projects** for potential new initiatives
4. **Consider creating** privacy-experience initiative

---

## 7. System Validation Results

### ✅ Working

- Notion MCP connection and database access
- Linear API for projects, issues, and cycles
- GitHub CLI for PR data retrieval
- ASK-XXXX pattern extraction from branch names
- Smart inference from Linear issues to projects

### ⚠️ Needs Attention

- Notion project IDs not yet populated in \_meta.json files
- Phase sync between Notion and local initiatives
- ~30% of GitHub PRs lack Linear references

### ❌ Not Yet Tested

- Full `/sync-dev` orchestration with Q&A resolution
- Notion Engineering Specs database extraction
- Notion Design Briefs database extraction
- Notion Launch Planning database extraction

---

## Next Steps

1. **Populate Notion mappings** - Run `/sync-notion` with `--create-missing` flag
2. **Review sync-queue.md** - Make decisions on ambiguous items
3. **Run full `/sync-dev`** - Test complete pipeline
4. **Verify artifact extraction** - Test Eng Specs and Design Briefs sync
