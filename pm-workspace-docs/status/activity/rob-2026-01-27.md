# What's New

**Monday, January 27, 2026**

Hey Revenue Team! Here's what the product team shipped that you can use with customers right now.

---

## What's New

**The app runs faster now** — We made several speed improvements behind the scenes. Pages load quicker, especially when you have a lot of conversations.

**@ mentions work better in chat** — When you mention a person or company in chat, AskElephant now understands what you're talking about more reliably.

**Mobile login is more reliable** — If you use the mobile app, logging in should work smoothly now. We fixed some issues with the login link.

## What We Fixed

- Fixed a bug where notification banners would show up at the wrong time
- Scrolling through long lists no longer jumps around unexpectedly
- Some icons were flickering on settings pages — that's fixed now
- Words in meeting details no longer get cut off mid-word
