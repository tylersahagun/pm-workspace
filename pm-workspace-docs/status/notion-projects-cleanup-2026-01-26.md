## Completed Actions

### 1. Schema Cleanup ✅
Removed 12 redundant properties:
- Design Briefs, Eng Specs (moved to Figma/Linear)
- Customer Conversations, Feedback (never used)
- Tasks, GTM Plans, 📤 GTM / Launch Plans (duplicates)
- 🎫 Product Tickets (inconsistent)
- Blocked by, Blocking, Parent item, Sub-item (complexity)
