## 🔴 Action Required (1)

### 1. Sam Ho wants to join a meeting/call
**Channel:** Product Group DM | **From:** Sam Ho | **Time:** Today

> "Tyler might be informative for me to join that as well, could you add me?"

**Why it matters:** Your new manager (5 days in) is asking to be included in something - likely a customer call or meeting. This is a great opportunity to loop him in and help him get up to speed.

**Recommendation:** Reply with context about what the meeting is and add him.

**Suggested response:**
> "Absolutely! I'll add you now. It's [describe meeting/context]. Let me know if you want any background before it."

## 🟡 Review (4)

### 1. Woody wants Sam in Plyon for roadmap
**Channel:** Private Group DM | **From:** Woody (CEO) | **Time:** Today

> "Can we get Sam into plyon so we can use it for product road map"

**Why it matters:** CEO is thinking about roadmap tooling and wants Sam involved. As PM, you should be aware of this tool discussion.

**Recommendation:** FYI for now. Sam or Woody will likely handle, but good to know roadmap tooling is on leadership's mind.

### 2. Email sent automatically without approval - TRUST ISSUE
**Channel:** #product-forum | **From:** Reuben Tang (AE) | **Time:** Today

> "While working a deal in AskElephant, I asked the chat to help me draft an email from the company page, but it ended up sending two emails automatically without an explicit approval step... A mandatory review and confirmation step before any outbound email is sent would be really helpful."

**Why it matters:** This is a CRITICAL trust/product issue. Emails are high-risk actions - sending without explicit user approval is exactly the kind of thing our product vision warns against.

**Resolution:** Kaden confirmed they can disable send email action and force it to use drafts.

**Recommendation:** Follow up to ensure this change ships. Consider adding this to a tracking doc for "AI guardrails" work.

### 3. HubSpot company matching without domain
**Channel:** #product-forum | **From:** Matt Bennett (SE) | **Time:** Today

> "MagicPlan, who works with construction companies, is trying to use that trigger but can't because a lot of the time they do not have a domain to attach to the company. Was wondering if we can think of any other work-arounds..."

**Why it matters:** Integration gap affecting customers. Construction companies often don't have domains, but they're still valid HubSpot companies.

**Recommendation:** 🟡 Product consideration - company matching alternatives beyond domain.

### 4. Bryan asking about AGENTS.md update
**Channel:** #team-dev | **From:** Bryan Lund | **Time:** Today

> "Did we update our AGENTS.md to follow this change in file structure?"

**Context:** Kaden merged a PR that moved a lot of contexts around. Bryan is checking if documentation was updated.

**Recommendation:** If you own AGENTS.md for the main codebase, verify it's up to date with file structure changes.

## 🟢 FYI (5)

### Company Updates
- **New engineer started:** Ivan Garcia joined the engineering team today. Bryan announced in #general.

### Product Forum

- **Analysis page UX:** Ben H flagged UX issue with loading state ("check back in a few seconds" but no refresh option). Dylan acknowledged it needs improvement.

## 📊 Signals (3)

### Churn Risk
| Customer | ARR | Status | Issue |
|----------|-----|--------|-------|
| **Cableteque** | $2,400 | Deactivated | Non-payment since October, not responding to outreach |
| **Gamify (Paiv)** | $8,398 | At-risk | 11 months silence post-close, no onboarding documented |

**Gamify Analysis:** Detailed post-mortem in #churn-alert shows severe onboarding gap - no kickoff, no CSM assignment, no success metrics tracked. This is a process failure signal.

### Wins
| Customer | Deal | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **NeuroNova** | Expansion (4 seats) | Moved from failed $4,752 deal to expansion via proof-of-concept demo |
| **Cloudchipr** | 1 seat ($1,200) | Closed today |
| **Elefante RevOps** | $8,520 total (5 deals) | Partner motion generating referrals |

**Key Win Pattern:** NeuroNova's recap emphasizes proof-of-concept breaking price objections - 10-minute demo of real workflow > feature pitches.

### Woody on Customer Data (#council-of-product)
