## Visibility Status (PostHog Analysis)

| Project | Visibility | PostHog Flag | Rollout |
|---------|------------|--------------|---------|
| Global Chat | GA | global-chat-* (12 flags) | 100% |
| CRM Agent Upgrades | GA | crm-agent-upgrades | 100% |
| Settings Redesign | Internal | unified-settings-page | 100% (but user marked Internal) |
| FGA engine | GA | fga-engine-beta | 100% |
| Notification Engine | GA | browser-notifications-feature | 100% |
| Universal Signal Tables | GA | run-signals-from-search-page-button | 100% |
| Rep Workspace | Internal | (none) | - |
| Call Import Engine | Internal | (none) | - |
| Feature Flag Audit | Internal | (none) | - |

**Note:** User marked Settings Redesign as "Internal" despite 100% PostHog rollout - indicates the feature is technically available but not officially launched/marketed.

## Recommendations

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Rep Workspace Linear Link** - Create a Linear project or link to existing one
2. **GTM Links** - Connect these Build+ phase projects to Launch Planning:
   - Observability & Monitoring
   - Notification Engine
   - FGA engine
   - Settings Redesign
   - Rep Workspace

### Manual Setup Required

**Add "Visibility" property values in Notion** - The property exists but has no values set. To populate:

1. Open [Projects Database](https://www.notion.so/ask-elephant/2c0f79b2c8ac802c8b15c84a8fce3513)
2. For each project, set Visibility based on PostHog analysis above
