## Key Findings

### North Star Validation

**Hypothesis:** "Workspaces with 3+ successful workflow runs per week retain significantly better"

| Metric       | Finding                                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Volume       | 106,631 workflow completions in 90 days        |
| DAU          | 1,500-1,900 active workflow users daily        |
| Weekly Trend | +18% growth over 3 months (275 → 324 sessions) |
| Pattern      | Clear B2B weekday pattern (5-10x weekend)      |

**Assessment:** PROMISING - Proceed as primary North Star candidate

### Activation Funnel

| Stage               | Count  | Conversion       |
| ------------------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| First Visit         | 38,481 | 100%             |
| Onboarding Complete | 44     | 0.11%            |
| First Workflow      | 23     | 52% of onboarded |

**Key Insight:** Post-onboarding workflow adoption is excellent (52%). Focus should be on improving onboarding completion.

### Data Warehouse Capabilities

| Source  | Tables                                                                      | Key Use Cases                 |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Stripe  | `stripe_charge`, `stripe_invoice`, `stripe_subscription`, `stripe_customer` | Revenue tracking, MRR, churn  |
| HubSpot | `hubspot_companies`, `hubspot_contacts`                                     | Company enrichment, deal data |
| PostHog | `events`, `persons`, `groups`                                               | Product usage, retention      |

**Critical Finding:** Can join Stripe to PostHog via `stripe_customer.metadata.workspaceId` → `groups.key`

## Instrumentation Gap Summary

### Critical Gaps (Block Company Analytics)

| Event Category | Issue                | Impact                               | Ticket   |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Agent Events   | No workspace context | Cannot track CRM adoption by company | EPD-1330 |
| Mobile Events  | No workspace context | Cannot attribute mobile usage        | EPD-1331 |
| Chat Events    | No workspace context | Cannot track chat usage by company   | EPD-1329 |

### High Value Additions Needed

| Event                       | Purpose                      | Status      |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| `search:performed`          | Search usage analysis        | Not tracked |
| `meeting:transcript:viewed` | Content engagement           | Not tracked |
| `chat:response:viewed`      | Automation value attribution | Not tracked |

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Review dashboard** - Verify data accuracy on new North Star dashboard
2. **Prioritize EPD-1329** - Chat workspace context is quick win
3. **Schedule retention analysis** - Run detailed D30/D60/D90 comparison

### Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Fix agent events** (EPD-1330) - Critical for Value Ladder measurement
2. **Run revenue correlation** - Join workflow data with Stripe MRR
3. **Create cohorts** - Implement Value Ladder tier cohorts

### Long-Term (Month+)

1. **Implement Health Score** - Rule-based scoring per company
2. **Configure alerts** - North Star drops, at-risk accounts
3. **Standardize naming** - Migrate to `domain:entity:action` pattern
