# Customer Journey Product — Lifecycle + Outstanding Work

## Sources
- Notion project: https://www.notion.so/2c0f79b2c8ac817ca1bdcf67c21fb76c
- Linear project: None linked
- Phase: Definition

## Outstanding Tasks (Linear)
Linear project not found for this initiative. Recommended to create one and
seed epics. Immediate tasks:
- [ ] Create Linear project and seed epics for discovery and design
- [ ] Define target personas and outcome chain
- [ ] Map current vs desired journey steps and key moments
- [ ] Identify MVP scope and dependencies (Signals/Tables)

## MVP → Beta → GA Lifecycle
- MVP: Deal-level journey map with core stages and key signals
- Beta: Expanded entity views (company/contact) + journey insights
- GA: Configurable journey definitions + workflow triggers + analytics

## Next Work (Estimate)
- 1–2 weeks: discovery synthesis + journey definition
- 2–4 weeks: MVP flow design and data model alignment

## Design/UX Gaps and Proposed Flows
Need a clear journey narrative and inspection surfaces.
- Journey view flow:
  1. User opens an account/deal.
  2. Journey timeline shows stages + key events.
  3. AI highlights “why” behind stage changes.
  4. User filters to specific signals (objections, competitors).
- Trust: include evidence links for every inferred stage.
