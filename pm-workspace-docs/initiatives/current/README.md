# Current Engineering Projects (Dev Sync)

This folder contains **synced engineering analyses** from Linear/Notion projects that are actively in development but haven't been promoted to full PM initiatives.

## Purpose

These files bridge PM workspace with dev tracking systems:
- Links to Notion projects and Linear projects
- Outstanding tasks from Linear
- MVP → Beta → GA lifecycle planning
- Design/UX gaps identified during development
- Next work estimates

## Status

| Project | Phase | Linear Issues | Notes |
|---------|-------|---------------|-------|
| capture-visibility | Done - Full Release | 3 P0s remaining | Post-launch polish |
| crm-agent-upgrades | Build | 44 total | Major migration work |
| customer-journey-product | ? | ? | Unclear status |
| fga-engine | Build | 7 P0s | Authorization system |
| global-chat | Build | 57 total (5 P0) | Bug fixes + polish |
| nerdy-tables | Definition | 1 | Maps to `universal-signal-tables` |
| notification-engine | ? | ? | Need to check |
| observability-monitoring | ? | ? | May overlap with `automated-metrics-observability` |
| privacy-determination-agent-v2 | ? | ? | Need to check |
| release-lifecycle-process | Definition | 0 | **DUPLICATE** - Use main initiative instead |

## Recommendations

1. **Keep for reference** - These provide useful engineering context
2. **Delete `release-lifecycle-process/`** - Duplicate of main initiative
3. **Merge `nerdy-tables/` context** into `universal-signal-tables` initiative
4. **Consider renaming folder** to `dev-sync/` for clarity

## When to Promote to Initiative

Promote a project here to a full initiative (`initiatives/[name]/`) when:
- It needs PM artifacts (PRD, design brief, research)
- It requires jury validation
- It has strategic product decisions to make
- It needs cross-team coordination beyond engineering
