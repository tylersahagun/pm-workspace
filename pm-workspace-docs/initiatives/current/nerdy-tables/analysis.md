# Nerdy Tables — Lifecycle + Outstanding Work

## Sources
- Notion project: https://www.notion.so/2caf79b2c8ac800aacc2e2b091dffd4b
- Linear project: None linked
- Phase: Definition

## Outstanding Tasks (Linear)
Mapped to Linear project **Universal Signals**.
Linear project issues: 1 total (likely incomplete scope in Linear).
Top item:
- [ ] ASK-4115: TS extractions use different recording context than chat attachments

## MVP → Beta → GA Lifecycle
- MVP: Engagements table + limited AI columns + manual re-run
- Beta: Deal-level tables + roll-up metrics + saved views
- GA: Multi-entity tables + templates + export + scalability targets

## Next Work (Estimate)
- 2–3 weeks: refresh Linear project with full MVP scope
- 4–6 weeks: data model + prototype validation work

## Design/UX Gaps and Proposed Flows
Needs a clear builder experience and trust in AI columns.
- Column builder flow:
  1. User creates table for an entity type.
  2. Chat-assisted column creation (prompt + examples).
  3. Preview on sample rows with confidence and evidence.
  4. Save column and run extraction in background.
- Trust: show receipts per cell and allow manual re-run.
