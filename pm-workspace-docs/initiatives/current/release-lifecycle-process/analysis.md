# Release Lifecycle Process — Lifecycle + Outstanding Work

## Sources
- Initiative docs: /Users/tylersahagun/Source/pm-workspace/pm-workspace-docs/initiatives/release-lifecycle-process
- GTM brief: Release Cycle Labels (Notion)
- Phase: Not explicitly tracked; treated as Definition/Planning

## Outstanding Tasks (Linear)
Linear project not found for this initiative. Immediate tasks:
- [ ] Finalize stage definitions and governance rules
- [ ] Create internal enablement assets (Sales/CS guidance)
- [ ] Implement beta UI and settings in-product
- [ ] Launch comms (internal + customer beta)

## MVP → Beta → GA Lifecycle
- MVP: Internal release labels + weekly release comms
- Beta: Customer-facing beta program UI + opt-in controls
- GA: Full lifecycle governance + analytics on beta adoption

## Next Work (Estimate)
- 1–2 weeks: finalize definitions and internal enablement docs
- 2–4 weeks: beta UI build and rollout plan

## Design/UX Gaps and Proposed Flows
Need clear, low-friction visibility of feature maturity.
- Beta opt-in flow:
  1. User opens Settings → Beta Features.
  2. Sees list with maturity badges and risk copy.
  3. Toggles feature and sees confirmation + learning link.
  4. In-product badges reinforce beta status.
- Trust: “what this means” copy and rollback option.
