# Research: Product Usability

## Summary
Umbrella initiative for improving overall product usability. High risk due to broad scope - needs guardrails and clear prioritization. Integrations work will be tracked under this initiative. Board created to track tasks.

## Source
- **Meeting:** Product Planning Session
- **Date:** 2026-01-16
- **Participants:** Woody, Tyler, Bryan, Skylar

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Integrations Falls Under Product Usability
**Status:** Confirmed
**Details:**
> "Product usability should just be the top project because integrations is a project inside product usability. It's how I'm gonna articulate it."

**Implications:**
- Integrations (Kaden's work) is a sub-project
- Broader scope for product usability team
- Need clear task breakdown

### Decision 2: User Story Format Required
**Status:** Confirmed
**Details:**
> "It has to be formatted as a user story. As a user, I know when my meeting I stopped my meeting through the desktop recorder, and I don't wait for a couple of thousand bucks."

**Format:** "As a [user], I [action] so that [outcome]"

### Decision 3: Form/Survey for Submissions
**Status:** Planned
**Details:**
> "I have a form I'll send out to literally everybody, and it can just be a product usability form, just an empty text box, like, almost nothing so that we can start having people that can just submit them."

**Owner:** Tyler

### Decision 4: Noxon Moving to Product Usability
**Status:** Confirmed
**Details:**
> "Noxon needs to move to product usability"

> "I think that's we didn't have a Kanban board so he can know the other stuff that he can be working on."

**Note:** User group sharing might still be assigned to Noxon as it's a significant win and in his headspace

### Decision 5: Board Created
**Status:** Done
**Details:**
> "I have a board already made. We got everything. I just added some stuff from the meeting."

## Example Issues Identified

### Desktop App Stop Button
**Problem:** Stop button has had "fluid indicator" issues - not usable
**Format:** "As a user, I hit the stop button on the desktop app and it works."

> "Like, the desktop app right now is not usable because that stop button has had fluid indicator. Now I know Eduardo knows that better, but that would be a type of task underneath."

### "Scooby Snacks" / Button Mashings
**Category:** Small usability fixes
**Description:** Little things that aren't obvious but impact experience

> "Some of those is, like, that calls them scooby snacks. We call them... Those little button mashings is gonna be, like, some of the things that are there."

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** HIGH

> "That's why we have huge high risk here. It does feel like the big, don't know, box that we can start looking at."

**Mitigation:** Need guardrails and clear prioritization

## User Problems Identified
| Problem | Severity | Frequency | Evidence |
|---------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Desktop app stop button unreliable | High | Common | "The desktop app right now is not usable because that stop button has had fluid indicator" |
| Unclear scope for usability work | High | N/A | "DISCUSS in PC - guardrails for the project?" |
| No intake process for usability issues | Medium | Common | "Everybody should be calling these out. We should have a mechanism for communicating those efficiently" |

## Process Requirements

### Submission Format
All submissions must follow user story format:
```
As a [user type], I [action] so that [outcome].
```

### Intake Mechanism
- Form/survey for all team members
- Kanban board for tracking
- Clear prioritization criteria needed

## Action Items
| Owner | Task | Timeline |
|-------|------|----------|
| Tyler | Send out product usability form/survey | Today |
| Tyler | Discuss guardrails in Product Council | TBD |
| Team | Populate board with existing known issues | Ongoing |
| Noxon | Move to product usability (or user group sharing) | TBD |

## Dependencies
- Integrations (Kaden's work - sub-project)
- Desktop app team (Eduardo)
- Engineering capacity

## Open Questions
1. What are the guardrails for this project?
2. How do we prioritize usability issues vs. new features?
3. Should this be data-driven (analytics) or feedback-driven?
4. Who triages incoming submissions?
