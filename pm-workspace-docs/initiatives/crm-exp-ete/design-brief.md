# Design Brief: CRM Experience End-to-End

## Overview

This design brief covers the complete CRM agent experience from initial setup through daily use. The core design challenge is **building confidence** through education, testing, and visibility.

> "I want to be able to actually test and see an output so that I have confidence. That's the key there is I need the confidence."

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Confidence First
Every interaction should build user confidence. Show, don't tell. Let users test before committing.

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
Start simple (one or handful of things), expand as confidence grows. Don't overwhelm.

### 3. Proactive Communication
The agent should communicate what it did, not wait to be asked. Surface issues before users discover them.

### 4. Clear Boundaries
Users should always know what data is being touched, where the agent is running, and how to stop it.

### 5. Appropriate Control
Admins get full control. Users get personal control. Both get visibility.

## Interaction Patterns

- Low (<50%): Red warning, requires review, full explanation

### Pattern: Before/After Comparison
- Side-by-side layout
- Highlight changes (green for additions, strikethrough for removals)
- Link to source (meeting transcript)

### Pattern: Quick Actions
- Approve: Single click, immediate feedback
- Reject: Single click, optional feedback prompt
- Edit: Opens inline editor, then approve

### Pattern: Progressive Loading
- Show skeleton states
- Load critical info first
- Lazy load details

### Pattern: Notification Preferences
- Channel selection (Slack, Desktop, Email, In-app)
- Frequency (Immediate, Digest, Off)
- Type filtering (HITL only, All, Errors only)

---

## Edge Cases

### Empty States

**No agents configured:**
- Illustration + "Get started" CTA
- Link to onboarding

**No activity yet:**
- "Waiting for first meeting" message
- Explanation of what will appear

**No pending approvals:**
- "All caught up" celebration
- Link to activity log

### Error States

**CRM connection lost:**
- Clear error message
- Reconnect CTA
- What data is affected

**Agent failed:**
- What went wrong
- What to do
- Retry option

**Low confidence match:**
- Multiple options presented
- User selects correct one
- Agent learns

---

## Accessibility Considerations

- All confidence indicators have text labels (not just color)
- Keyboard navigation for all actions
- Screen reader announcements for status changes
- Focus management in modals and flows
- Sufficient color contrast
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px

---

## Design References

### Internal
- HubSpot Agent Config UI v3 (`prototypes/src/components/HubSpotConfig/v3/`)
- Notification patterns in existing app
- Workflow builder UI patterns

### External
- Linear's inbox and notification patterns
- Notion's onboarding flow
- Zapier's automation builder simplicity
- Slack's notification preferences

---

## Open Design Questions

1. How do we visualize "everywhere the agent is touching" without overwhelming?
2. What's the right density for the activity log?
3. How do we make anomaly detection feel helpful vs alarming?
4. Should personal automations be in a separate section or integrated?
5. How do we handle mobile for HITL approvals?

---

## Prototype Priorities (Revised per James's Stack)

Based on 2026-01-16 planning session, priorities have been reordered:

### Q1 Focus (James's Priority Stack)

| # | Prototype | Rationale |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | **Workflow Visibility Dashboard** | "I don't know if it just failed or never hit triggers" |
| 2 | **Manual Enrollment/Test** | "To test something, I have to trigger 40 other workflows" |
| 3 | **AI Context Indicators** | Guide users to correct nodes for CRM workflows |
| 4 | **Property Creation Flow** | "Would you like to create them? Yes." |

### Future (Post-Q1)

5. **Onboarding Wizard** - Confidence-building flow
6. **Agent Communication Center** - User daily experience
7. **Inbox** - HITL approval workflow
8. **Anomaly Alerts** - Proactive surfacing

---

## New Flow: Manual Enrollment/Test

**Goal:** Let admins test workflows without contaminating production data or triggering other HubSpot workflows

```
Workflow Detail View
├── "Test" button in header
├── Opens: Record Selector
│   ├── Search HubSpot records
│   ├── Filter by: Deal, Contact, Company
│   ├── Show recent records
│   └── Select one record
├── Opens: Test Preview
│   ├── "Run as if this met trigger criteria"
│   ├── Dry run option (show what would happen)
│   ├── Execute option (actually run, but isolated)
│   └── Results appear in visibility dashboard
└── Results View
    ├── What was updated (or would be)
    ├── Confidence scores
    ├── Link to HubSpot record
    └── "Adjust workflow" CTA if issues
```

**Key Design Requirements:**
- Clear labeling: "This is a TEST run"
- Isolation indicator: "Other HubSpot workflows will NOT be triggered"
- Results clearly marked as test in activity log
- One-click to convert test → production run

---

## New Flow: Workflow Visibility Dashboard

**Goal:** Show exactly what each workflow did—which records, when, successes, failures

```
Workflow List View
├── List of all workflows
├── Each shows:
│   ├── Name
│   ├── Status (active/paused/error)
│   ├── Last run timestamp
│   ├── Success rate (last 7 days)
│   └── "View runs" CTA
└── Quick filters: All, Active, Errors

Workflow Run History (New Screen)
├── Selected workflow name + status
├── Stats: Total runs, Success rate, Avg confidence
├── Run list (newest first):
│   ├── Timestamp
│   ├── HubSpot record (linked)
│   ├── AskElephant event (linked)
│   ├── Status: ✓ Success / ✗ Failed / ⏳ Pending
│   ├── Confidence score
│   └── Expand for details
├── Filters:
│   ├── Date range
│   ├── Status (success/failed/pending)
│   └── Confidence range
└── "Chat with workflow" CTA (future)

Run Detail View
├── Full context:
│   ├── Meeting that triggered
│   ├── HubSpot record updated
│   ├── Fields changed (before/after)
│   ├── Confidence per field
│   └── Any errors/warnings
├── Links:
│   ├── Open in HubSpot
│   ├── View meeting in AskElephant
│   └── Edit workflow
└── "Rerun on this record" CTA
```

---

## New Screen: Property Creation Flow

**Goal:** Create/repurpose HubSpot properties from within workflow builder

```
Property Needed Dialog
├── Triggered when workflow needs field that doesn't exist
├── "This workflow needs: Deal Stage Reason"
├── Options:
│   ├── "Use existing field" (shows matches)
│   │   ├── List of similar unused fields
│   │   └── "These fields exist but aren't used recently"
│   ├── "Create new field"
│   │   ├── Name (pre-filled)
│   │   ├── Type (auto-suggested)
│   │   └── Description
│   └── "Skip this field"
├── Preview: "This will create/use field X in HubSpot"
└── "Approve & Continue" / "Cancel"
```

**Key Design Requirements:**
- Never create without explicit admin approval
- Always show existing fields first
- Explain why field is needed
- Show impact: "This will appear in HubSpot under Deal Properties"
