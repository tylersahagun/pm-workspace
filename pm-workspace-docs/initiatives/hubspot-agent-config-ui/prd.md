# HubSpot Agent Configuration UI PRD

## Overview

- **Owner:** Tyler Sahagun
- **Target Release:** Q1 2026
- **Status:** Draft
- **Research:** [James Hinkson Interview](../../research/user-interviews/2026-01-06-hubspot-agent-configuration-james-hinkson.md)

---

## Problem Statement

### What problem?

Configuring the HubSpot agent to update CRM fields correctly requires complex prompt engineering spread across 3-4 workflow nodes. Users spend **100+ hours** learning to configure agents through trial and error, with zero visibility into what's happening or why.

### Who has it?

- **RevOps admins** trying to set up CRM automation
- **Sales leaders** who want accurate forecasting via automated field updates
- **HubSpot partners** evaluating AskElephant for CRM integration

### Why now?

> "We've had a lot of partners and clients who use the HubSpot agent, like, twice. It does something. They don't know what it does. So they turn it off and they'll never use it again."

Partner churn is directly tied to configuration complexity. The trust loss cascades:

> "The trust isn't lost in a single workflow... It's 'I don't trust AskElephant with my information or to manage my CRM.'"

### Evidence

| Data Point                                                | Source                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 100+ hours to configure properly                          | James Hinkson interview |
| Partners abandon after 2 uses                             | James Hinkson interview |
| Marketing attribution runs 1/5 of the time, cause unknown | Internal testing        |
| Testing requires 10PM-3AM isolated sessions               | James Hinkson interview |

## Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals (Measurable)

- [ ] **5 minutes** to configure a single property update (vs. current ~10 hours of prompt iteration)
- [ ] **50 minutes** to configure a complete 10-field workflow (vs. current 100+ hours)
- [ ] **30% increase** in HubSpot agent retention (users who configure → continue using)
- [ ] **Zero prompt engineering required** for standard use cases

### Non-Goals

- **Custom code execution** — This is configuration, not a scripting environment
- **Non-HubSpot CRMs** — Salesforce/other CRMs are separate initiatives
- **Replacing workflows entirely** — This improves the HubSpot agent node, not workflow architecture
- **Real-time streaming updates** — Batch timing is sufficient for MVP

---

## User Personas

### Primary: RevOps Admin

- **Job-to-be-done:** Configure AskElephant to automatically update HubSpot fields after every sales call so data is accurate for reporting
- **Current pain:** "It's this nightmare of a prompt that I spent forever putting together and lives in three or four different nodes"
- **Success looks like:** "I know 100% confidently that every field I want updated in HubSpot is updated after every call"

### Secondary: Sales Leader

- **Job-to-be-done:** Set up automated deal scoring and probability calculations to improve forecast accuracy
- **Current pain:** "Testing is a nightmare... between 10PM and 3AM when no one else is online"
- **Success looks like:** "Come in here and say, Josh is gonna close $70,000 next month" with confidence

---

## User Stories

### Configuration

- As a **RevOps admin**, I want to **select HubSpot properties from a dropdown** so that I don't have to write prompts that reference internal field IDs
- As a **RevOps admin**, I want to **define instructions per property** so that each field update has clear, isolated logic
- As a **RevOps admin**, I want to **specify field dependencies** so that the agent reads context before writing
- As a **Sales leader**, I want to **set custom scoring rules** so that deal probabilities reflect my specific business logic

### Visibility

- As a **RevOps admin**, I want to **see which fields will be updated before running** so that I can verify my configuration
- As a **RevOps admin**, I want to **preview the read-before-write chain** so that I understand the data flow

### Trust

- As a **HubSpot partner**, I want to **configure in 5 minutes** so that I can evaluate AskElephant's value quickly
- As a **RevOps admin**, I want to **toggle append vs. overwrite per field** so that I don't lose historical data

## User Flows

### Flow: Configure a New Property Update

**Trigger:** User clicks "Add Property" in HubSpot agent configuration

**Steps:**

1. Property selector opens showing HubSpot properties for selected object type
2. User searches/filters and selects "Close Date Probability"
3. Configuration panel expands below the selected property
4. User enters instruction: "Based on the conversation, estimate probability of closing by the stated close date. Consider objections raised, buyer enthusiasm, and timeline discussed."
5. User enables "Read before write" toggle
6. User selects dependencies: [Sales Skill Score, Why Will This Fail, Buyer Involvement]
7. User selects write mode: "Overwrite"
8. User enables "Sync to HubSpot" toggle
9. Configuration saves automatically

**Outcome:** Property is added to the agent's update list with full configuration visible

**Success Metric:** < 5 minutes from start to saved configuration

---

### Flow: View Field Dependencies

**Trigger:** User clicks "View Dependencies" or expands dependency section

**Steps:**

1. Visual diagram renders showing:
   - Properties that will be READ (inputs)
   - Property being WRITTEN (output)
   - Order of operations
2. If circular dependency exists, show error with specific fields involved
3. User can click any node to edit its configuration

**Outcome:** User understands data flow before execution

**Success Metric:** User can identify dependency issues without running the agent

---

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies

- HubSpot API integration (existing)
- Property metadata fetching from HubSpot
- Workflow node schema updates

### Integration Points

- Existing workflow builder UI
- HubSpot agent execution engine
- Activity/audit logging system

### Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HubSpot rate limits on property fetch | Medium | Low | Cache property list, refresh on demand |
| Complex dependency chains cause execution delays | Medium | Medium | Limit dependency depth to 3 levels |
| Users create circular dependencies | High | Medium | Detect and block at save time |
| Existing prompt-based configs need migration | High | High | Run both systems in parallel; gradual migration |

### Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1:** New UI available alongside existing prompt interface
2. **Phase 2:** Auto-convert simple prompt configs to structured format
3. **Phase 3:** Deprecation warning on prompt-only configs
4. **Phase 4:** Full migration, prompt interface removed

---

## Success Metrics

### North Star

**Configuration-to-value time:** Minutes from starting configuration to first successful HubSpot update

| Segment                       | Current       | Target       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| New partner (first config)    | 100+ hours    | < 30 minutes |
| Experienced admin (new field) | 30-60 minutes | < 5 minutes  |

### Leading Indicators

- % of new HubSpot connections that complete first configuration
- % of configured agents that execute successfully on first run
- Time spent in configuration UI per property
- Template adoption rate

### Guardrails

- No increase in failed HubSpot writes due to configuration errors
- No increase in support tickets about "agent not working"
- Maintain < 2s UI response time for property fetch

---

## Open Questions

1. **Migration:** How do we handle existing complex prompt configurations that can't be auto-converted?
2. **Permissions:** Should field-level sync toggles be admin-only, or can any user configure?
3. **Validation:** How do we validate instructions before execution? LLM-based check?
4. **Audit log:** Where does configuration history live? Can users revert changes?
5. **Scorecard:** Is the weighted scorecard builder MVP or post-MVP?
6. **Testing:** What does "Preview Output" actually show without running against a real transcript?

---

## Appendix

### Competitive Landscape

| Product         | CRM Config Approach                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Fathom          | 5 basic fields, no customization ($29/mo)     |
| Fireflies       | Meeting notes only, no field mapping ($20/mo) |
| Gong            | Enterprise-grade, complex setup               |
| **AskElephant** | Custom configurations (our differentiator)    |

> "If all we're doing is pushing meeting notes, then great. Fireflies does that for $20... The thing that we genuinely sell that no one else does is custom configurations." — James Hinkson

### Key Quotes from Research

**On the core problem:**

> "There is zero confidence that an admin or rep can find out why things were updated the way they were in the CRM."

**On desired experience:**

> "When I click on that instead of an agent prompt, it has, like, select the properties from HubSpot you wanna update. And I literally pick the record type and the property specifically."

**On complexity:**

> "Being able to dictate that order will be great. Instead, it's this nightmare of a prompt that I spent forever putting together and lives in three or four different nodes."

**On success:**

> "My outcome is that I know 100% confidently that every field I want updated in HubSpot is updated after every call."
