## Summary

The jury evaluation identified several gaps in our understanding. This document outlines targeted research to address them.

## Critical Research Needs

### Adoption Stage Deep Dives

**Skeptic Users (18.2% pass rate)**

Research questions:
1. What specific past experiences have made you skeptical of AI tools?
2. What would it take to earn your trust with a new AI tool?
3. What's the minimum proof you need before trying something new?
4. What's your biggest fear about AI in your workflow?

Interview targets: 5-7 users who self-identify as skeptical of AI

### Archetype-Specific Research

**Operations (48.0% pass rate)**

This archetype is underperforming. Research needed:
1. What specific workflows does this archetype have that we're not addressing?
2. What competing tools are they currently using?
3. What would make them switch from their current solution?
4. What's unique about their day-to-day that we're missing?

Interview targets: 3-5 operations users

### Concern-Driven Research

## Research Methods

| Method | Target | Timeline |
|--------|--------|----------|
| User Interviews | 10-15 users | 1-2 weeks |
| Competitive Analysis | Top 3 competitors | 3 days |
| Usability Testing | 5 users per variant | 1 week |
| Survey | 100+ responses | 1 week |

## Next Steps

1. Schedule interviews with users from underperforming segments
2. Create interview guides based on questions above
3. Conduct competitive analysis on friction points
4. Re-run jury evaluation after research synthesis
