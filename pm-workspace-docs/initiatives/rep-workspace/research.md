## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Prototype Today
**Status:** Committed
**Details:**
> "Producing right after these meetings for prototypes for rep workspace, and I'm gonna go to some of our reps. Eileen gets feedback and talk to them about that."

**Timeline:** Today

### Decision 2: Internal Testing First
**Status:** Planned
**Details:**
> "And then if we can get some customers as well, I'll talk to them about it as well. I wanna get a decent sense, like, v one."

**Approach:**
1. Build prototype
2. Show to internal reps (Eileen)
3. Gather feedback
4. Potentially show to customers

### Decision 3: Connection to Customer Journey
**Status:** Conceptual
**Details:**
> "I think we're gonna have a rep workspace. But what's gonna go on the rep workspace? I think it's gonna go on the customer... like, a customer's like, a journey is gonna be there as well."

**Implication:** Rep workspace connects to customer journey mapping

### Decision 4: Global Chat Integration
**Status:** Related
**Details:**
> "Are we getting global chat done today based off of our agreement?"

Global chat is a related initiative that affects where chat appears in the rep workspace.
