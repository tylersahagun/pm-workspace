# GTM Brief: Composio Agent Framework

**Initiative:** composio-agent-framework  
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-22

## Value Proposition

**One-liner:** Connect your tools to AskElephant and let AI agents automate the busywork—so you can focus on selling and serving customers.

**Expanded:**
AskElephant now connects to 877+ integrations (Slack, HubSpot, Salesforce, Gmail, and more) through AI agents that can take action on your behalf. Instead of building complex workflows, just tell the agent what to do in plain English.

## Target Segment

### Phase 1: Universal Agent Node

| Segment | Fit | Why |
|---------|-----|-----|
| **RevOps / Ops leaders** | Primary | Already building workflows, want more power |
| **Technical admins** | Primary | Comfortable with integration configuration |
| **Power users** | Secondary | Will adopt once admins set it up |

### Phase 2: Agent Configurator

| Segment | Fit | Why |
|---------|-----|-----|
| **All workspace admins** | Primary | Can create templates without workflow expertise |
| **Individual contributors** | Primary | Can adopt templates with 1-click |
| **Solutions/CSM teams** | Secondary | Can pre-configure agents for customers |

## Key Messages

### For RevOps / Admins

1. **"877 integrations, one node"**
   - Connect Slack, HubSpot, Salesforce, Gmail, ClickUp, and hundreds more
   - No custom code required

2. **"Tell the agent what to do in plain English"**
   - Write instructions like you'd tell a colleague
   - AI figures out which tools to use

3. **"Transparent automation"**
   - Service accounts keep it clear: "AskElephant did this"
   - No more "why did my admin create this task?"

### For End Users (Phase 2)

1. **"Adopt automations in one click"**
   - Your admin already configured the agent
   - Just connect your accounts and go

2. **"Personal agents, personal productivity"**
   - Draft follow-up emails automatically
   - Never miss a CRM update

3. **"You're in control"**
   - See exactly what the agent does
   - Disable anytime

### For Leaders / Executives

   - As easy to set up as a Slack bot

## Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | Their Approach | Our Differentiation |
|------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Zapier/Make** | Visual workflow builder with nodes | AI agent writes the logic—just describe what you want |
| **Native CRM automation** | CRM-only, limited integrations | 877 integrations, conversation context built-in |
| **Generic AI assistants** | General purpose, no tool access | Deep meeting context + action execution |
| **Point solutions** | Single-integration automation | Unified platform, cross-integration intelligence |

**Our moat:** We have the meeting context. Competitors can connect tools, but they don't know what was said in the call. AskElephant agents combine conversation intelligence with action execution.

## Customer Impact

### Time Savings

| Automation | Time Saved | Frequency |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| CRM update after call | 5-10 min/call | Every call |
| Follow-up email draft | 10-15 min/call | Most calls |
| Task creation in project tool | 3-5 min/task | Several/day |
| Slack summary to channel | 5 min/call | Every call |

**Estimated impact:** 1-2 hours/day for active users

### Revenue Impact

- Faster follow-ups → Higher response rates → More pipeline
- Better CRM hygiene → Accurate forecasting → Better planning
- Less admin time → More selling time → Higher quota attainment

### Adoption Impact

- Simpler automation → More users adopt → Higher seat utilization → Expansion revenue

## Messaging Don'ts

❌ **Don't say:**
- "We have 877 integrations" (sounds like feature bragging)
- "Replace your workflows" (implies current workflows are bad)
- "AI does everything" (overpromises, hurts trust)
- "Like Zapier but better" (invites comparison)

✅ **Instead say:**
- "Connect the tools your team already uses"
- "A simpler way to automate"
- "AI that takes action, with you in control"
- "Meeting intelligence meets workflow automation"

## Open GTM Questions

1. **Pricing:** Are agent executions unlimited? Per-seat? Usage-based?
2. **Integrations highlight:** Which 10-15 integrations do we feature prominently?
3. **Partner co-marketing:** Opportunity with Composio? Integration partners?
4. **Customer stories:** Who are beta candidates for case studies?
5. **Competitive response:** How do we expect competitors to react?
