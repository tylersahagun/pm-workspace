# Flagship Meeting Recap PRD

## Overview

**Owner:** Tyler Sahagun
**Target Release:** Q1 2026
**Status:** Draft
**Strategic Pillar:** Data Knowledge + Trust Foundation

Transform the meeting recap experience from a workflow byproduct into a first-class, flagship artifact. Users configure their meeting summaries through natural conversation, see beautiful dedicated views, and edit outputs in-place without navigating to workflows.

This initiative establishes the "zero to one" foundation for AskElephant's core value proposition: turning customer conversations into trusted, actionable insights.

---

## Outcome Chain

```
Chat-based meeting recap configuration enables natural language template setup
  → so that users can customize recaps without learning workflow complexity
    → so that they actually use and trust AI-generated meeting content
      → so that they engage more deeply with AskElephant daily
        → so that we reduce adoption-related churn (currently 42%)
          → so that NRR improves and expansion opportunities increase
```

**Secondary Chain (Communication Channels):**

```
Channel selection (Slack, HubSpot, Teams, email) for recap delivery
  → so that recaps arrive where users already work
    → so that manual CRM logging decreases
      → so that rep productivity increases
        → so that customers see ROI on AskElephant investment
```

## Problem Statement

### The Problem

Today, to get a meeting recap, users must:

1. Navigate to Workflows
2. Create or find the right workflow
3. Configure prompts, triggers, and output settings
4. Test with a real call (no preview)
5. Wait for output in a chat thread
6. If they don't like it, hunt for the workflow to edit

**This is unacceptable for our flagship experience.**

The result: 42% of churn is "failure to adopt" — users never see value because the complexity barrier is too high.

### Who Has This Problem

| Persona          | Pain Level | Current Workaround                        |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Sales Rep**    | High       | Ignores AI outputs, takes manual notes    |
| **CSM**          | High       | Uses separate note tool (Fathom, Granola) |
| **Sales Leader** | Medium     | Gets inconsistent recap quality from team |
| **RevOps**       | Low        | Doesn't interact with recaps directly     |

### Why Now

1. **Sam's directive (Jan 27):** "Prioritize a flagship meeting summary experience"
2. **Churn data:** 42% of churns are adoption failure (Slack synthesis)
3. **Competitive pressure:** Fathom wins on simplicity despite fewer features
4. **Global Chat readiness:** Feb 1 beta enables in-place editing pattern
5. **Portable Artifacts:** Matt's work unblocks dedicated artifact views

### Evidence

| Source                  | Quote                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tyler-Sam (Jan 28)      | "You should never have to actually edit a workflow just to get a meeting recap"  |
| Sam (Jan 27)            | "A workflow an average user doesn't wanna deal with... it's too complicated"     |
| Tyler (Council, Jan 26) | "Here's 47 workflow outputs and chats that you will never look at"               |
| CSM Team (Slack)        | "Workflows will not re-run when you make changes... onboarding gap"              |
| Customer (Slack)        | "Gong workflows are pretty shit, to be honest. So I'm happier with this system." |
| Churn Data              | 42% of churns attributed to "failure to adopt"                                   |

## Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals (Measurable)

| Goal                              | Metric                        | Target                            |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Reduce time to first custom recap | Setup completion time         | < 3 minutes (from ~30 min)        |
| Increase recap engagement         | Views per user per week       | 3x baseline                       |
| Reduce adoption churn             | "Failure to adopt" churn rate | -30%                              |
| Improve output customization      | Users with custom templates   | 50%+ of active users              |
| Enable channel delivery           | Recaps delivered externally   | 25% of recaps pushed to Slack/CRM |

### Non-Goals

| Non-Goal                                      | Reasoning                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Replace Workflows entirely**                | Power users still need full workflow builder; this is the "easy path" |
| **Build custom templates for every use case** | AI should generate from natural language; we don't ship 100 templates |
| **Real-time in-call summaries**               | Out of scope; focus on post-meeting experience first                  |
| **Multi-language support**                    | English only for MVP; i18n in future                                  |
| **Mobile-native experience**                  | Web-first; mobile gets responsive version                             |

## User Flows

### Flow 1: First-Time Template Setup

**Trigger:** User completes onboarding or clicks "Configure Recap" in settings

**Steps:**

```
1. Chat opens: "Let's set up your meeting recaps! What types of calls do you have?"
                                         ↓
2. User responds: "Discovery calls, demos, and follow-ups"
                                         ↓
3. AI: "Great! I'll create templates for each. Let's start with Discovery calls.
        Here's a preview → [ARTIFACT PREVIEW]
        What would you change?"
                                         ↓
4. User: "Make it more bullet-pointed, less narrative"
                                         ↓
5. AI updates preview, shows new artifact
                                         ↓
6. User: "Perfect"
                                         ↓
7. AI: "Discovery template saved! Now let's do Demos..."
                                         ↓
8. Repeat for each type
                                         ↓
9. AI: "All set! Your recaps will now use these templates automatically.
        You can always edit them by clicking the feedback icon on any recap."
```

**Outcome:** User has 3 custom templates in < 3 minutes

**Error states:**

- User doesn't respond → reminder after 30s, save partial progress
- User says something unclear → AI asks clarifying question
- Preview fails to generate → show skeleton with "Generating preview..."

**Trust recovery:**

- Always show "You can change this anytime"
- Provide "Reset to default" option

---

### Flow 2: Viewing Recap After Meeting

**Trigger:** Meeting ends, user navigates to meeting page

**Steps:**

```
1. Meeting page loads with tab bar: [Recap] [Coaching] [Prep]
                                         ↓
2. Recap tab active by default, shows polished artifact
                                         ↓
3. User scans recap, sees something they don't like
                                         ↓
4. User clicks feedback icon (top-right corner)
                                         ↓
5. Global chat opens with context: "I'm looking at the recap for [meeting].
   What would you like to change?"
                                         ↓
6. User: "Add a section for competitor mentions"
                                         ↓
7. AI: "I'll add that to your Discovery template. Preview: [ARTIFACT]
        Apply to future calls?"
                                         ↓
8. User: "Yes"
                                         ↓
9. Template saved, confirmation shown
```

**Outcome:** Template updated without leaving meeting page

**Error states:**

- Global chat unavailable → show "Edit in Workflows" fallback link
- AI can't parse request → ask clarifying question

**Trust recovery:**

- Show "This changes future recaps, not past ones" (or offer to regenerate)
- Undo option for template changes

---

### Flow 3: Sharing Recap to Channel

**Trigger:** User clicks "Share" on recap artifact

**Steps:**

```
1. Share modal opens with channel options:
   [Slack] [HubSpot] [Teams] [Email] [Copy]
                                         ↓
2. User selects "HubSpot"
                                         ↓
3. Modal shows: "Add to: [Deal: Acme Corp Q1] | [Contact: John Smith]"
   Preview: [How it will appear in HubSpot]
                                         ↓
4. User confirms "Add to Deal"
                                         ↓
5. Recap pushed to HubSpot activity timeline
                                         ↓
6. Success confirmation with link to view in HubSpot
```

**Outcome:** Recap in CRM without copy-paste

**Error states:**

- HubSpot disconnected → prompt reconnection
- Deal/contact not found → search interface
- Push fails → retry with error message

**Trust recovery:**

- Always show preview before send
- "Edit before sending" option
- Confirmation required (no auto-push without consent)

---

## Trust & Privacy Considerations

### Privacy Determination Integration

- **Prerequisite:** Privacy Determination Agent must classify meeting privacy BEFORE recap generates
- **Behavior:** If meeting is "Private," recap only visible to attendees
- **Sharing:** Private meeting recaps cannot be shared externally without explicit override
- **Audit:** Log all share actions for compliance

### Trust Safeguards

| Risk                                  | Mitigation                                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| AI hallucinates customer name/company | Show source attribution; user can verify before sharing      |
| Wrong template applied                | Show detected type; user can override before recap generates |
| Recap shared to wrong channel         | Confirmation modal with preview; undo within 30s             |
| Template edit has unintended effects  | "Preview on sample meeting" before saving template           |
| Auto-detected tag is wrong            | Allow manual override; learn from corrections                |

### Data Handling

- Templates stored per-user in user preferences
- No meeting content stored in template (only structure/prompts)
- Share audit log retained for compliance
- User can delete all templates (reset to defaults)

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                       | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Meeting type detection inaccurate          | Medium | Medium     | Manual override + learning loop            |
| Users confused by chat config              | High   | Low        | Progressive disclosure; fallback to wizard |
| Template changes break existing workflows  | High   | Medium     | Migration path; parallel systems           |
| Channel push permissions fail              | Medium | Medium     | Clear error messages; reconnection flow    |
| Scope creep into full workflow replacement | High   | Medium     | Explicit non-goal; phase gating            |

---

## Open Questions

1. **Migration:** How do existing workflow power users transition? Parallel paths or migration wizard?
