This document outlines the qualification criteria and evidence needed to move a deal forward with **AskElephant**.

---

## 1. Pain Acuteness

> “This problem is costing me too much to ignore.”

### **What needs to be true:**

- Lack of trust in pipeline/forecast (embarrassing them with CFO/board).
    
- Limited visibility into deal health (deals slip unexpectedly).
    
- Reliance on lagging vs. leading indicators (can't intervene early).
    
- No scalable coaching framework (can't get reps to perform consistently).
    
- CRM chaos (reps not updating, data quality destroying forecast accuracy).
    
- Low close rate and missing numbers.
    

### **Evidence:**

- Recent missed forecast that caused leadership scrutiny.
    
- They use words like **"embarrassing," "can't trust,"** or **"constantly surprised."**
    
- They're spending 10+ hours/week manually auditing pipeline.
    
- They mention specific deals that slipped without warning.
    
- CFO/CEO has explicitly demanded forecast improvement.
    

### **Signs this has NOT been achieved:**

- They describe problems in generic terms: _"Yeah, CRM updates are annoying."_
    
- No recent catalyst or triggering event—pain is chronic but tolerable.
    
- Can't quantify impact: _"I don't know exactly what it costs us."_
    
- They're exploring multiple solutions with no urgency.
    
- When asked _"What happens if you don't solve this?"_ they shrug or say _"We'll manage."_
    
- They use words like **"nice to have"** or **"would be helpful."**
    
- No leadership pressure or accountability driving need to solve.

## 2. Value Conviction

> “I believe AskElephant will solve my problem and the ROI is clear.”

### **What needs to be true:**

- They believe we specifically solve their pain (not just generic AI promise).
    
- They understand why we're different/better than alternatives (Gong, Chorus, status quo).
    
- They can articulate the value in their own words.
    
- The ROI is clear and quantified—they can defend it to their CFO.
    
- They trust our product roadmap aligns with their evolving needs.
    

### **Evidence:**

- They say **"This is exactly what we need"** in their own words.
    
- They ask about implementation timeline, not whether it'll work.
    
- They can explain to their team why AskElephant vs. alternatives.
    
- They've built or validated the business case (time saved, forecast improvement, etc.).
    
- They bring stakeholders to demos to show them the value.
    
- They reference specific workflows solving specific problems.
    

### **Signs this has NOT been achieved:**

- They're **"still evaluating options"** after seeing the demo.
    
- They keep comparing features to Gong/Chorus without understanding differentiation.
    
- They say _"It's interesting"_ but can't explain why it's valuable.
    
- They can't articulate ROI or say _"I need help building the business case."_
    
- They ask for features we don't have as blockers.
    
- They question whether AI is reliable or accurate.
    
- They focus on price before understanding value.

## 3. Stakeholder Alignment

> “Everyone who matters is on board.”

### **What needs to be true:**

- **Champion:** Actively selling internally (not just interested).
    
- **Economic Buyer (CFO/CRO):** Understands and approves ROI.
    
- **Technical Buyer (RevOps):** Confident in integration.
    
- **End Users (Sales Managers):** See value, not a threat.
    
- **Gatekeepers (IT/Security):** Have approved or will approve.
    

### **Evidence:**

- Champion brings stakeholders to calls.
    
- Multiple people from their team attend demos/meetings.
    
- They say _"I've talked to [CFO/CRO] and they're supportive."_
    
- RevOps/IT is asking detailed questions (engagement = validation).
    
- End users are asking _"When do we get access?"_
    
- Champion shares internal emails or messages showing stakeholder buy-in.
    

### **Signs this has NOT been achieved:**

- Champion is alone on every call—can't get others engaged.
    
- They say _"I need to get buy-in from..."_ with no plan or timeline.
    
- RevOps or IT is MIA—not engaged at all.
    
- Sales managers are skeptical or openly resistant.
    
- Champion says _"I'm working on getting everyone aligned"_ for weeks.
    
- They can't get the CFO on the calendar or say _"CFO doesn't need to be involved yet."_
    
- IT raises blockers late in the process (security, compliance, integration concerns).

- They ask for discounts before understanding ROI.
    
- They mention a **"tight budget"** with no plan to find funds.
    
- They say _"Let's revisit next quarter"_ with no compelling event.

- RevOps is disengaged or hasn't validated technical fit.
