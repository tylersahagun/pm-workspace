[0:00:00] Josh: I think I can do that.

[0:00:01] Pete Belliston: So in regards to the customer journey and everything that you're telling us about, this dashboard, the piece that takes me the most time, it's not just the following up, sending the email. The piece that I have to, like, take time away is now I have to go create a document. I have to go create a one page.

[0:00:17] Josh: I have

[0:00:17] Pete Belliston: to go create those things. Yeah. If there's something that AskElephant can do that helps me create those documents, that is huge for me. Like, they're asking me to get certain information from, like, a video of a workflow or something. I know that's that's a bigger ask, but, like, those things are what take me to time.

[0:00:41] Pete Belliston: It's not like, sending the email is easy. I can get a email generated with, like, that piece a new UI. A massive time saver. Yeah. It should get a little sound.

[0:00:51] Pete Belliston: Okay.

[0:00:51] Josh: But that's sick.

[0:00:52] Pete Belliston: K. It's kinda broken. It's because it's so loud in here. Yeah. It's just one sound blast.

[0:00:58] Pete Belliston: Yeah. So this this So that's why I'm trying to talk at it. The two visualization kills me. We gotta clean that up up. No.

[0:01:05] Pete Belliston: I hear you on that. Yeah. That makes perfect sense. But, like, I mean, what you're saying is great. Yeah.

[0:01:10] Pete Belliston: But I think people are gonna just want that extra Oh, totally. Because that's what the time savings really is. Yeah. It's like the higher level outcome that we're that we're attributing to is I know where my customers are in their journey. I think that's half the coin.

[0:01:28] Pete Belliston: The other side of the coin is, okay. Now what do I need to do to

[0:01:32] Josh: Yeah. What are the paths to get done to do that? And I think

[0:01:35] Pete Belliston: it's tell me if I'm missing anything here. But it's there's customer must do and things that they need to do. Yeah. With this first task. This means that you submit it to, you do as the run.

[0:01:47] Pete Belliston: And then the other thing about the business is like RevOps is creating, like, a more consistent template based on things you need to do. You need to ask a certain legal question. You need to them to see, like, you know, this is almost those that where it starts and then each because it's customer deals. Yeah. You're gonna have additional things that you need to do that kinda get tacked on.

[0:02:12] Josh: So I've broken it out as there's because I gotta write this up for our partner this weekend. There's the revenue journey. Have you seen the revenue bow tie?

[0:02:24] Pete Belliston: I know what

[0:02:24] Josh: yes. Where usually you just see top of funnel like this, and then you really look at if you flip it, it's a bow tie.

[0:02:31] Pete Belliston: Correct. There's a customer actually showed me a tool, and they actually have a UI that shows their entire business pipeline in the bow tie There you go. And you can actually drill in and then kinda get more detail in each section.

[0:02:42] Josh: So I can't remember what

[0:02:43] Pete Belliston: tool that

[0:02:44] Josh: was. So you got the revenue bow tie awareness. I forget the second one. It's they're deciding, then they commit, then it's closed, then it's onboarding, then expansion, then it's retention. And you could go through that cycle again and again.

[0:03:03] Josh: Anyway, along that are the different roles or personas that play a part at each thing. K? So the thing I've realized, the three variables that apply across that whole thing are data, process, and people. K.

[0:03:22] Pete Belliston: K? So you Tell me

[0:03:23] Josh: about this. You've got the data. So let's just go from a lead.

[0:03:26] Pete Belliston: K.

[0:03:27] Josh: The lead comes in, data. We wanna know everything about the lead. The process would be what channel did they come from? How do we get them in there? Like what was the process for that lead, the data, for the lead to get in?

[0:03:43] Josh: And the person. The person who set that up, and the person you're targeting. The personas.

[0:03:49] Pete Belliston: Right? Okay.

[0:03:49] Josh: For that stage awareness, that's everything. And there's a view for that. Yeah. A dashboard, like the view for that marketing person. Yeah.

[0:04:00] Josh: They could see that. And now you go to the second stage, SDR, BDR. Okay? Again, now they take the lead data, MQL, passed off. So now data, process, that's their process.

[0:04:13] Josh: They need a call. It goes in a Chili Piper. Process also includes tools that are used. And then the person, coaching. Are they coached right or are they not?

[0:04:23] Josh: These are the workflows that make that up and make a system. Okay? The systems that make this up. And what I've seen is that CRMs and everything right just tell you that they a lot of data and have a process. People are what move dates.

[0:04:46] Josh: Yeah. And along each of that stage, those things you were just talking about is like, okay. So did we qualify them ICPs? So great. That's just a framework like, do they have HubSpot?

[0:05:01] Josh: Do they have Salesforce? Like, think of our ICP process. Are they b to b SaaS? Is this a decision maker or is it IC? That profile that's then passed over

[0:05:11] Pete Belliston: to the AE to do the

[0:05:11] Josh: demo. But now you needed to do Bail. Actual sales process of did I do pain agitate solution? So, okay. I might have got the pain, but did I agitate?

[0:05:28] Pete Belliston: Sorry. What's agitate?

[0:05:29] Josh: Okay. So

[0:05:30] Pete Belliston: Diaper. The

[0:05:32] Josh: common example is you take a knife, you stick it into someone Okay. And you say, where does it hurt? Here. And then you turn the knife, and that agitates it.

[0:05:42] Pete Belliston: Okay. So

[0:05:43] Josh: that'd be like, you have a stomach pain. Let me me talk about that. Okay. Let me push on your stomach pain. Is that where it really hurts, Skyler?

[0:05:52] Josh: This is like solving like a business problem or pain or something like that.

[0:05:57] Pete Belliston: Yeah. But they need really feeling it? Yeah. But they need and they need to feel that pain. Yes.

[0:06:00] Pete Belliston: Yeah.

[0:06:01] Josh: Well, as part of the sales process, if you don't do that, you become a a a relationship seller relationship seller. Of like a challenger or like a you don't sell the value at that point. Right. So your things you're talking about surfacing is like this deal is at Damn. Yeah.

[0:06:26] Josh: This deal is at risk because you didn't go deeper. Right. But visually is what people wanna see.

[0:06:34] Pete Belliston: That makes sense. I think

[0:06:37] Josh: go ahead.

[0:06:37] Pete Belliston: So it's funny because I don't know if this is a recent thing, me and Rob are actually talking about this today. Okay. And where I almost wanna call this thing, it's a customer led journey. Meaning, contrary, like, today, it's like businesses like, hey, this is our process. We bring customers through it.

[0:06:58] Pete Belliston: That's still mostly true, but it's like, the journey that me and the customer go on together needs to be led by them. I'm I'm guiding them, but, like, I can't until they actually feel those things

[0:07:11] Josh: Dude, you are nailing classic, like, how can you make your buyer's process as simple as possible? Yeah. Easy to buy. Well, just if you focus on a customer led journey Steve Jobs talks about this. He's like, if you focus on a customer led journey, you will learn how to help them buy easy.

[0:07:33] Josh: So I really like what you're talking about. Yeah.

[0:07:36] Pete Belliston: So a more precise question is, I have magic wand. If I have this workspace and and when you're in full swing with this, it's not gonna be you're gonna be logging in each morning like, oh, what do I need to do? You're gonna come in and you're gonna kinda know if you can do it. So I wanna know if you imagine a new workspace where there's a mixture of like, okay, calendar's only half the thing. Like, meetings is half the job.

[0:08:07] Josh: That's it. Yeah. That's Less than half the Less

[0:08:09] Pete Belliston: than half the job. The majority is, k, what are the things I need to act on or approve or do? So I don't wanna bias you with that. I think that's, like, the baseline. But, like, what are those things that that you care about?

[0:08:21] Pete Belliston: Oh, I earn each day. What do you care about? Let's start with agreeing with the statement. Help me phrase it. You wanna know at any given moment right now at lunch, where can I make the biggest impact given my deals that I'm carrying to help you with the long term?

[0:08:41] Pete Belliston: Yeah. Be I wanna How would you phrase that?

[0:08:43] Josh: I wanna, like almost like my my deal desk or my pipeline, but, like, it's it's pretty simple. Like, I need to know I need to be able to see really easily, um, of the pipe I'm working, who has the highest probability, what steps have been taken, and these are the tasks that need to be done. Like, I need to know the email's been sent. I need to know, am I waiting for them to send me something? Am I waiting for them to send so there's tasks.

[0:09:19] Josh: There's the meeting itself. There's the quality of that lead, that person I'm talking to.

[0:09:27] Pete Belliston: Which attributes to probability of closure. Right?

[0:09:30] Josh: Oh, 100%. But the the problem with the CRM right now is I have to, like, go dig to get this story together. Whereas if, you know, our meeting space?

[0:09:44] Pete Belliston: So cute. Oh, was a lot. That's a lot of the spicy. I'm sorry. No.

[0:09:48] Josh: I I like spice. Like, I know these things are same thing, but their name. Wanna know who are the the DMs, the decision makers, so account laughing. I wanna know who I've talked to.

[0:10:04] Pete Belliston: I haven't heard that before. Account mapping?

[0:10:06] Josh: Yeah. Account mapping is like classic, like, doesn't matter if it's say it like door to door. Who's your champion?

[0:10:11] Pete Belliston: Who's the signer? Who's legal? Like, all that

[0:10:15] Josh: because it's like, I'll show you like the UI I want when we

[0:10:18] Pete Belliston: get back.

[0:10:18] Josh: But like, I'm having to use a a tool called Centralize

[0:10:24] Pete Belliston: to I wanna see it.

[0:10:25] Josh: To show that I talked Zoya's my champion outside, partner. Gabby is the a decision maker and an influencer, but she's not a champion right now. Jeff is not a DM, he's an influencer and a champion. The economic buyer is the CFO and Mike who's the CEO actually says I will follow when Jeff and mainly Gabby sign off on this.

[0:10:57] Pete Belliston: So Okay. Makes sense.

[0:11:00] Josh: When you're working a deal, it doesn't matter if it's door to door sales or whatever. Like, if I knock on your door, are you guys the decision make do you make decisions together or do I have enough influence Are you the homeowner? Today. Yeah. The the cycle of a deal doesn't change.

[0:11:19] Josh: The who's involved in the complexities, that's what makes it hard. And then it's knowing like, okay. So if I send a gift to Gabby today that she because she likes the outdoors, specifically she likes this coffee, and I go spend $50 on that, and now

[0:11:39] Pete Belliston: the likelihood of closing that

[0:11:40] Josh: deal jumps from 50% to 80%. Like

[0:11:44] Pete Belliston: How can you for that specific example, is there

[0:11:49] Josh: how do you how do

[0:11:50] Pete Belliston: you measure that? I don't

[0:11:52] Josh: I don't know how, but you and I know. We've done this long enough to, like like, I'm gonna send her a gift. Why? Because I've already built rapport. I have this.

[0:12:02] Josh: I have this. I need one last thing to help her make the move.

[0:12:09] Pete Belliston: All yours.

[0:12:16] Josh: But that would be like on the idea section. Here's ideas of to help close this deal. You could implement one of them. Like drag it into your almost like when I'm looking at a deal, would drag it and be like I used this tool to help. Because it's like Pete does this really good.

[0:12:35] Josh: He doesn't realize he does it. He's just natural at it. He takes people on the Sandler submarine, which is pain agitation solution. He does it really naturally. What he doesn't do naturally is systems processes and, like, breaking down the deal in this way.

[0:12:55] Pete Belliston: But because it's That's why your monks are back loaded and not front loaded? I don't know. I'm sure there's a shit ton that could

[0:13:06] Josh: Oh, I don't know about that. I just know, like, on traditional sales, he's way better. Like, way better than anyone else on

[0:13:15] Pete Belliston: the floor.

[0:13:16] Josh: Myself included.

[0:13:17] Pete Belliston: Out of three people.

[0:13:19] Josh: No. But I've worked with a lot of people and you would be a top at any

[0:13:22] Pete Belliston: company. Yeah.

[0:13:24] Josh: Anyway, so there's for my dashboard, it's like I wanna see my tasks, I wanna see my deals, I wanna see my coaching, and I wanna see next. Okay. And I either wanna go click send that email or review, but basically I just need to know did it did that get done? What's the follow-up? So if you look at civil, attention, and momentum, they're focusing really heavy on helping their the individual be able to manage their tasks.

[0:13:57] Pete Belliston: Yeah. Because,

[0:14:00] Josh: you know, fortune's in the follow-up,

[0:14:02] Pete Belliston: but it's the task that you have to, like, manage at the end of the day. Okay. Let me ask a question on that. So if I'm in this, like, if I'm in this dashboard, I see these tasks. Yeah.

[0:14:11] Pete Belliston: Is it hey, Pete. Thank you, man. Yeah. Just I I might have to come here tomorrow.

[0:14:18] Josh: Good night.

[0:14:18] Pete Belliston: Good evening.

[0:14:26] Josh: Dee, can I get a water?

[0:14:27] Pete Belliston: Water? Thank you. Okay. So I'm I'm imagining for, like, each of you. What's up, man?

[0:14:43] Pete Belliston: How's it going?

[0:14:44] Josh: Good. How are doing? Good.

[0:14:47] Pete Belliston: Mean, question I'm sorry. The question is Shoot. I I kinda hope so. A list of of of tasks.

[0:14:54] Josh: Every role has task to do.

[0:14:55] Pete Belliston: Correct. Doesn't matter. Am I wrong where, like, that seems like a big list? It seems huge for every deal. At any given moment, you might have five, ten, 20.

[0:15:05] Josh: Get your project man to test, especially Per deal. With our type of product. Yeah. Yeah. Because just the sales to see us hand off for

[0:15:14] Pete Belliston: us Multiple personas. Right. I would assume. I know. Exactly.

[0:15:17] Josh: And the multiple workflows that need to be accomplished for that role.

[0:15:21] Pete Belliston: Yeah. Well, if you do it in That's right. Because partners, you're really doing a lot of that setup

[0:15:25] Josh: for them. Well, even their clients that we sell. It doesn't matter the the persona we sell to Yeah. Or the client type. It's like when we do a hand off to Erica or anyone, I know that the quicker I can get Erica to get on the same page of, like, these are the current workflows that we can move fast to get them speed to value instead of just doing, like, basic.

[0:15:53] Josh: The quicker I can customize that for them, the faster I know they expand, the faster I know Yeah. Everything happens. Yeah. And it's like.

[0:16:00] Pete Belliston: So, yeah, there's there's It's tasks. There's tasks. So I I is it is there's obviously some ranking and sorting and you could go into each customer you're working with and see those specific tasks. Does that make sense to have, like, a high level task on this, like, top level dashboard view, like, workspace view? Like, here's your tasks ranked by, like, impact or urgency?

[0:16:23] Pete Belliston: 100%. Yeah. So you may have, let's say, six, and you may have you're just gonna have those I think the need for that is it has to be, like we have to have some kind of framework for what it should be, but it should be able to be customized by the company because they're gonna care Sure. You know, about different things. For you, what what what would dip like, if you were to take right now What ones are most likely to close?

[0:16:47] Pete Belliston: End of the month. What what ones are most likely

[0:16:49] Josh: to close?

[0:16:49] Pete Belliston: That should be the overarching, like, it's likely this one, like. Yeah. Okay. So that that's early stage in the sales process. I need to get those follow ups fast because that's gonna be it's gonna move them faster the faster I follow-up.

[0:17:03] Pete Belliston: Yeah. I hear. And the ones that are close to closing, those ones also. Yeah. Like, it's like maybe it's how quickly I'm following up after a meeting is probably dictates really highly of them moving through the sales funnel.

[0:17:19] Pete Belliston: Totally. So first first kind of layer of sorting is like likely whole likely likelihood to close. Yeah. Not no.

[0:17:26] Josh: It's not

[0:17:26] Pete Belliston: just likely that it's how because because they may be early in the stage, highly likely to close. So that's not just it. Is it also the next layer is, like, k, far into the sales cycle are we? Or that, like, that shouldn't have any particular I it's I don't know that that should wait necessarily. Okay.

[0:17:45] Pete Belliston: Let me look I'm thinking it's more How do you like, right now, it's Thursday. Example, like, right now in your guys' heads, how are you prioritizing your tasks? And I know, like, likelihood to close. Fucking paid for this for the company card. Yeah.

[0:18:05] Pete Belliston: Actually No. Actually Yeah. Woody. Getting Andrew to reimburse him. No.

[0:18:13] Pete Belliston: I'm kidding. I think it is gonna be a lot of because every deal is different, but it's deals that are closing that month. Like, they're closed, they wanna make a decision. When does the customer want to make a decision? That should be a high priority because I need to get them all the information early, like, legal, and so we can get through that whole process before they're gonna sign.

[0:18:40] Pete Belliston: So I need to have those tasks done early in the month to be able to close by the end of month. Yep. That's probably overarching. It's what the customer's time like. So so okay.

[0:18:51] Pete Belliston: Maybe how about this? Maybe what I'm thinking is that I'm I'm getting quite quite solution based into this workspace here. Yeah. It it it it's it's never really gonna be just like a single list. There should be some there should be, like, at any given moment, some high urgent things.

[0:19:06] Pete Belliston: This is your big focus. Do these things. But then, like, it's be like it's more I have I see my deals, and I should be able to click into each deal and then kinda work

[0:19:16] Josh: from that way. Because I feel like do

[0:19:18] Pete Belliston: you guys work where it's like, okay. I'm gonna do this task for five minutes for this deal, then I'm gonna do this email. Let me do this. Or is it like, I'm gonna kinda, like, focus on this this deal itself and do these 10 things, then move on to the next one. If I'm in

[0:19:31] Josh: between, I send the recap email as fast as possible. Then there's always tasks that I have to do from that that I know I'm not gonna be able to get done then. End of the day, I have time blocked when to get those tasks done for those oh, I love it. So cute. For those deals, for those individuals really.

[0:19:55] Josh: Yeah. And then and I have to check mark them and make sure I got them that way.

[0:20:01] Pete Belliston: Yeah. This might be a

[0:20:02] Josh: slight But then I know there's a follow-up because I in a couple days or whatever, if I'm waiting on something from them, I need to almost have like a way to be like

[0:20:11] Pete Belliston: And do you manage a lot do you manage a lot us with that centralized tool you talked about or no? No. I manage it by Yeah. How do I send it so Gmail has a thing that if they haven't responded to me within three days

[0:20:22] Josh: Yes.

[0:20:23] Pete Belliston: It sends me, like, a, hey. They Oh, I know. You have to put yourself on. That is how I manage it. Or that would be my For for back forth communication.

[0:20:31] Pete Belliston: Yeah. But sometimes it's like, hey, I need to go build a one pager. How do you manage those types of tasks? Sometimes I don't. Yeah.

[0:20:42] Pete Belliston: Sometimes I mean like, I I know I need to get them done so they're in my task list for each thing and so it's managed. But you said tasks, like, where is that task? HubSpot. Hubs HubSpot.

[0:20:52] Josh: You do use HubSpot? Mine has never detailed enough from HubSpot.

[0:20:55] Pete Belliston: But I'd love to see that. We can we can

[0:20:58] Josh: I have to go like this right now? I take all of my tasks from the call, create a, like, a task list, and then I time block those into my calendar. I time block my tasks into my calendar. Otherwise, it doesn't get done.

[0:21:14] Pete Belliston: Oh, I see. Yeah. But I do that also. I I do that

[0:21:17] Josh: as well. Because if you don't put it in a time block, it's it will get done.

[0:21:25] Pete Belliston: Nope. Josh did air quotes during that.

[0:21:27] Josh: Say that again?
