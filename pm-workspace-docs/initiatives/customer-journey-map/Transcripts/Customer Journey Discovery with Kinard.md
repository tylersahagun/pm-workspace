[0:00:00] Benjamin  Kinard: I don't care.

[0:00:01] Skylar Sanford: Uh, I'm I'm working on a customer journey product that is measured by really two outcomes. The first one is reps, and I say reps loosely. Uh, this is sales and post sales. K. I met with Jazz and Parker about the same thing but from a different angle.

[0:00:23] Skylar Sanford: Our users will know where their customers are in the journey. So that that's that should be true. This product will help them know where their customers are in the journey.

[0:00:36] Benjamin  Kinard: We had a customer talking about this today.

[0:00:37] Skylar Sanford: Okay. Perfect. But to define journey a little bit, there's different sales stages. The way we've been thinking about the customer journey is one single journey from initial contact all the way to future success. You know, SDR sales, customer success.

[0:00:57] Skylar Sanford: And then the second big outcome that comes with this is that users know precisely what they need to do to make impact and progress those customers through the journey. Right? Huge selling point. Are these

[0:01:14] Benjamin  Kinard: gonna be visuals in the product?

[0:01:16] Skylar Sanford: Yes. K. Perfect. When this releases, we need to figure out there's gonna be milestones. This is a big product.

[0:01:23] Skylar Sanford: That's why I call it product. There's a lot to this. The more I talk and after I talk with you, I hope that it actually goes bigger. So I'm actually not trying to solutionize too much yet, but I have some, like, solution ideas I wanna pitch to you. So the first version is gonna give initial value mostly to the reps because that's where we feel like the rubber hits the road a lot.

[0:01:43] Skylar Sanford: But I do wanna get your perspective from a sales leader Mhmm. On there. And so there's figuring out when do we actually go public with it. Like, when do we actually launch? Like, at what like, how many personas do we wanna hit on the initial launch?

[0:01:56] Skylar Sanford: Because this product then will will will impact every persona that we have.

[0:02:06] Benjamin  Kinard: You didn't upload the recording.

[0:02:11] Skylar Sanford: Did this did this make you think of Just today. Something. Just today. Actually, click on because sometimes it's been doing this. Click show details.

[0:02:22] Skylar Sanford: Wait. Wait. Wait. Go to maybe just click on the company, and maybe it actually showed up Yeah. Nice.

[0:02:33] Skylar Sanford: He might have recorded it just on his phone or something.

[0:02:35] Benjamin  Kinard: Yeah. Okay. Break down. Break down the few feature that Jason described from Gong that was a visual representation of deals in flight, stages, touch points, next steps, recommended actions.

[0:03:34] Skylar Sanford: I said steals in flight, but it got it. So this

[0:03:48] Benjamin  Kinard: was top two of what this sales leader's primary lead interest, like, love what they loved most about Gong. This was top top two.

[0:04:03] Skylar Sanford: K.

[0:04:04] Benjamin  Kinard: Deal activity timeline board. Visual representation. A visual map showing deal progression over specific time frame. Key elements shown. Touch points.

[0:04:13] Benjamin  Kinard: Every single one. Activity owner, contact engagement, strategic value for manager's visibility to rep activity as well as deal health. This helps with forecasting, real time forecast indication. Jason mentioned this was one of the features I'm gonna genuinely value, but AskElephant's approach folks is more than a driven task automation here. Blah blah blah blah.

[0:04:37] Benjamin  Kinard: So what you're this what you're talking about is there's infinite value behind it and wouldn't make us a a serious contender in in the space.

[0:04:49] Skylar Sanford: That's where I think it's the the first launch of this becomes the first version of an outcomes platform that we're been preaching Yep. Internally. I would actually love to understand your role. When you come in each day, what are some of the main things that you're driving? Okay.

[0:05:17] Skylar Sanford: And that I actually and I know that you're doing sales yourself. I actually want more of the the leadership perspective.

[0:05:29] Benjamin  Kinard: Well, there's not there's not an army to really lead yet, but

[0:05:36] Skylar Sanford: Who? You have you have Ruben and I have Cook. And Cook. That's right. I forgot because never see it.

[0:05:45] Benjamin  Kinard: And I have Adia and her team.

[0:05:47] Skylar Sanford: Correct. Right. Okay. That's what I understood. Yeah.

[0:05:49] Skylar Sanford: Yeah. Yeah.

[0:05:51] Benjamin  Kinard: Today, there's a new business stand up that typically happens. It was still it was overbooked. So I spent time with James today level setting on plans with his progression.

[0:06:06] Skylar Sanford: Okay. Talk to me about that. Yeah. Oh, plans for his progression? Yeah.

[0:06:11] Skylar Sanford: Yeah. What does he wanna be? Does wanna move into sales?

[0:06:15] Benjamin  Kinard: Well, he's in he's in sales. He's ready for s for AE one. Oh, genius?

[0:06:20] Skylar Sanford: I thought he was in SDR. Maybe last year. But my plan was

[0:06:23] Benjamin  Kinard: to move him up

[0:06:24] Skylar Sanford: to k. Yeah.

[0:06:25] Benjamin  Kinard: Yeah. Yeah. January 1. But we haven't been able to get a a higher cross the line.

[0:06:32] Skylar Sanford: I would replace him first. I see. Yeah.

[0:06:38] Benjamin  Kinard: What I'm doing primarily is especially right now, it's all hands on deck, just attacking revenue. Yeah. That's why I went with today to go get this deal across the line, which closed, which is great. I spend a lot of time in forecasting I'm making sure everything is crystal clean, crystal clear for Yep. Rob.

[0:07:05] Benjamin  Kinard: I'm coaching. I am you name it, dude.

[0:07:11] Skylar Sanford: So you started from the calendar. How much of your calendar drives your day?

[0:07:23] Benjamin  Kinard: Well, that's why I have this up. Yeah. I see that. Mhmm. So I never miss anything.

[0:07:29] Skylar Sanford: Because calendar events are primary.

[0:07:32] Benjamin  Kinard: Yeah. I mean, it's constantly changing, and I get I'm often invited to stuff that I I miss or I don't see. And so it gets pretty wacky.

[0:07:44] Skylar Sanford: Oh, so you got this. You said about that. Do you time block for different, like, tasks you need to do?

[0:07:50] Benjamin  Kinard: Yeah. I'm I'm using this quite a bit more focus time.

[0:07:55] Skylar Sanford: Yeah. Yeah.

[0:07:56] Benjamin  Kinard: Keeping it busy so I can focus on strategy and building. I'm putting together a a full project for this is some research I was doing on PRP. Don't if you ever heard of that. You you wouldn't know. You don't have to worry about it.

[0:08:14] Skylar Sanford: I don't know what PRP is.

[0:08:19] Benjamin  Kinard: I'm building a full encyclopedia to have my LLN ingest and learn a lot of what I built, not just in this role, but previous, right, all of leadership to help start structuring all the Yeah. Different changes that we need to build process we need to build that we can scale. Sure. That's what the majority of my time is going to go into coming into '26 is building repeatable process we can scale with. So, like, onboarding and demo process and how it changes with this industry and this product and Mhmm.

[0:09:10] Benjamin  Kinard: Batter cards and a curriculum. I need to build a whole curriculum for onboarding and coaching and training and development.

[0:09:20] Skylar Sanford: Yeah. I wanna go back to the revenue piece. Revenue piece. You obviously, you need to move the needle on revenue, and that's obviously a big portion of your focus is making sure your team hits. You met with Ruben today on a particular deal that's been closed.

[0:09:36] Skylar Sanford: How do you know at a glance? I'm sure that's through a lot of constant check ins with your team and just being aware. Yeah. But how do you know, given your team, what's actually the deals that you should be involved with to move the needle? So

[0:09:53] Benjamin  Kinard: this is the forecasting. K. I spent a lot of time here. Toggle between this month and next month. K.

[0:10:01] Benjamin  Kinard: So if it's in this month, that means the projected close date is for in month. Yep. So this is what we have that's already closed or that's outstanding to close. So if I wanna kick in to Ruben here

[0:10:15] Skylar Sanford: Sorry. Go back. What what I know the team's small, and if you had 15 to compare against, it would be like, if you had limited time, you had to really prioritize certain reps that you're gonna focus on, what here is helping you deduce? Which ones where where can I have more impact? Another one for another day.

[0:10:33] Skylar Sanford: And which reps can I drop the ball on or ignore?

[0:10:40] Benjamin  Kinard: Right here, the the amount of pipeline that's in their name. K. So Cook, right now, he's got he's only got three deals that have a chance of closing this month. This rep's got 50,003 deals that have a chance of closing

[0:10:59] Skylar Sanford: this month. Who's that gagging?

[0:11:01] Benjamin  Kinard: This guy's got a bunch. I mean, there's there's no there's no sales org where you're not going to prioritize every rep. Sure. Because there's going to be, like let's say there's a time where I've got three managers underneath me, and then each of them have five or six reps underneath them. I fully expect that in situations like this when we're pushing really hard for a goal that we need to hit for the whole year that impacts, you know, series a Yes.

[0:11:37] Benjamin  Kinard: I fully expect that each of those leaders will do a deep dive deal review with every single rep Mhmm. At least weekly and report back in a format like so. I can just pull it up here in my report.

[0:11:57] Skylar Sanford: The manager this is a report the manager would present back to you or

[0:12:01] Benjamin  Kinard: okay. So remaining pipeline breakdown number four in my Oh, so

[0:12:05] Skylar Sanford: this is what AD is reporting back

[0:12:06] Benjamin  Kinard: to you? No. This is me.

[0:12:09] Skylar Sanford: This is me. This so it's sorry. Who's filling out the report and who's reviewing the report? Me.

[0:12:16] Benjamin  Kinard: This is my report that I do for my org. K. Rob is is reviewing this for his report. Mhmm. So this is me.

[0:12:24] Benjamin  Kinard: And by the

[0:12:26] Skylar Sanford: way, I need a copy of this. I love that you have, like, a template and stuff, and I'm just winging it in Slack every breathing week. So you inspired me.

[0:12:33] Benjamin  Kinard: Sure, dude. Go go ahead. Like, you have access to this. I invited you to it. Yeah.

[0:12:38] Benjamin  Kinard: It's it's all structured for weeks in advance here, so I can just Yeah. Do my verbal dump let's get it done. Yeah. And I keep such channel cleaner if I can just drop a link instead. But this is what I was talking about, this pipeline review.

[0:12:58] Benjamin  Kinard: Each of my reps would do a meaningful pipeline review status?

[0:13:03] Skylar Sanford: Mhmm. Mhmm. I've I learned that we have because of AskElephant in HubSpot, I think Ben showed me or James showed me it. On a on a individual company, there's basically a workflow output through AskElephant that gives pretty detailed game plan of where to attack and, like, what to do. I feel like that's super killer and, like, super, like, rubber hits the road Yep.

[0:13:34] Skylar Sanford: Artifact that one is not being delivered in a good way in HubSpot because you ask often. So, like, right now, I actually I really wanna pull that type of artifact as, like, not to get too solution based, but there's gonna be a huge huge emphasis on the company view itself and not just individual events. We're very event focused, but it's back to the company in the events of the aggregate. Mhmm. I think that a lot

[0:14:02] Benjamin  Kinard: of the when you go

[0:14:03] Skylar Sanford: to a company, there's kind of like a homelander for each company. Mhmm. That is, like correct me if I'm wrong, I feel like that document should be, like, front and center, like, to give reps a detailed game plan. But it's not just rip read only output. It's, hey.

[0:14:20] Skylar Sanford: Here's what AskElephant has actually done for you and queued up. You just need to approve and hit send. Yeah. Sometimes that's sending over stuff. Sometimes it it can't do the thing.

[0:14:29] Benjamin  Kinard: Yep. So so each of these the process I just described to you, like a manual deep dive deal review Yeah. Person as well as this page here and this shit here. Like, this is this is dog shit. Like, this is absolutely inefficient and horrible, which is why your product concept at this this is so crucial for sales leaders to be able to get a really clean visual through AskElephant of everyone's pipeline, health assessment, ICP scoring, touch points, meetings held, follow ups, next recommended next steps, visual like that what did he call it?

[0:15:19] Benjamin  Kinard: He called it a deal activity timeline, like, board for for leadership and for ICs. So this would be so huge if you were actually working on this and, like, delivering this sometimes soon.

[0:15:36] Skylar Sanford: It'd be massive. It is my number one focus right now. It'd be massive. I'm glad to hear that, actually.

[0:15:42] Benjamin  Kinard: So a big

[0:15:45] Skylar Sanford: actually, don't care to get into the the actual journey details because there's a lot that goes into the different previously called stages. Right? So I have to

[0:15:57] Benjamin  Kinard: come in here really quick.

[0:15:58] Skylar Sanford: I have

[0:15:58] Benjamin  Kinard: to come in here, and I have to look at where the status, like, where it's at. And if I want more, I have to click all the way in, or better yet, I would just grab the the customer name prospect name. And just like you said, I would search for the oops. So center field.

[0:16:24] Skylar Sanford: Do check this out. Hit what is it called? Now hit command k, and then hit at, and then search center field. Oh, actually, I don't know if you have it turned on. I need to turn it on for you.

[0:16:35] Skylar Sanford: Oh, yeah. And then just hit enter. Oh, yeah. Like, tag them. So do that again, but then actually hit enter when it pulls up.

[0:16:43] Skylar Sanford: Just like Slack, you can actually tag the the the customer. There you go. And then just hit

[0:16:52] Benjamin  Kinard: enter. And

[0:16:55] Skylar Sanford: most of the time, it opens them up sometimes because it's deterministic. It's it's alpha. Okay.

[0:17:02] Benjamin  Kinard: Oh, cool. I usually just go to customers and type it out there.

[0:17:06] Skylar Sanford: I think if you do it your way, you would have gone there faster. Until until the command k becomes a little more natural. So anyways

[0:17:14] Benjamin  Kinard: I can run any one of these and get updates or I can just say what's going to move this deal forward.

[0:17:22] Skylar Sanford: Yeah. Which correct me if I'm wrong, that question shouldn't even have to be asked, but that output it's gonna give you should just be always present.

[0:17:31] Benjamin  Kinard: Right? I like that.

[0:17:34] Skylar Sanford: I mean, I don't wanna, like inject bias but like Let me ask let me reframe that as a question. If you're viewing a customer center field, I know there's different reasons you're coming here. But if you were to like from your perspective as a leader Mhmm. What would be the primary thing that you wanna see about this company at a given point in time? Yeah.

[0:17:54] Skylar Sanford: What what would that

[0:17:55] Benjamin  Kinard: be? The only reason I'm going to specific customer, like, focus like this with all of their meetings is to build content for for GammaDex like this to get prompted It's background, dude. Wow. To build something like this or I'm checking

[0:18:20] Skylar Sanford: Oh, the two top. There's your screenshots you were talking about, dude. Yeah. You weren't lying. I would never assume that of you, man.

[0:18:29] Benjamin  Kinard: I I I think it'd be really cool to have I mean, I don't think the prompt has to I think it could just be an option right here. Like a, you know, a collateral build out that's pretemplated or a, you know, a sales status or deal like, progression status. I don't know. I don't think it has to be would that look differently for someone searching from CS or look I don't know.

[0:19:05] Skylar Sanford: That's I don't know that question. This is mainly to show, like, the global chat that we're moving to, but I wanna bring your attention to how I'm thinking about how events and customers actually show up. So here, you're looking at a customer class research, and there's actually now dedicated areas within that customer. So when you come here, you should, like, land on the home. Now I think the home's gonna be all the high impact stuff.

[0:19:36] Skylar Sanford: But you're also gonna have a list of contacts. Maybe there's account mapping in there. Docs I can associate, you know, their contract. You can have other third party media attached to there as well.

[0:19:48] Benjamin  Kinard: Is this, like, flagging that this is waiting on this?

[0:19:51] Skylar Sanford: Yeah. So then the events and this is meant to be a timeline. Has more detailed designs. But imagine here on this timeline actually, just like what this guy was asking in the beginning you showed me, you're actually seeing dots to give you a visualization of the timeline and this could be filtered to thirty days, ninety days, whatever you want. So in this example, I'm actually imagine I've clicked on an event, which is happens to be an email.

[0:20:19] Skylar Sanford: And so now I'm actually viewing this email event that is associated with class research, of course. And then here, this artifact can actually stay static, and then I can actually start just having a conversation with class. So I can actually navigate different stuff, and I'm not having different conversation on different events. I'm having a conversation about the customer.

[0:20:46] Benjamin  Kinard: That's awesome. That was okay. So what is this? Did I already lose it? Where sorry, man.

[0:21:03] Benjamin  Kinard: It's 10:00. I'm

[0:21:05] Skylar Sanford: Hey. Sorry. As long hey. If you guys hit sixty hours, you can go home. Okay?

[0:21:09] Skylar Sanford: Just kidding. Stat.

[0:21:14] Benjamin  Kinard: So here's a here's a complaint. Not a complaint, but a flag. Why why am I having a hard time pulling

[0:21:20] Skylar Sanford: this stat? Yeah. What's up with that?

[0:21:25] Benjamin  Kinard: Like, Ruben didn't have this problem today. I I did.

[0:21:29] Skylar Sanford: K. This is gonna be weird. Actually, it was I wanna I wanna Oh, okay. Bug tries to go back to search the the search page

[0:21:36] Benjamin  Kinard: Alright. Let's see.

[0:21:37] Skylar Sanford: Or here. Companies. Now hit hard refresh the whole webpage and search it again. And it doesn't pull up at all. We know it exists.

[0:21:52] Skylar Sanford: We just pulled it up. No. Wait. Yeah. Right there.

[0:21:56] Benjamin  Kinard: There it is.

[0:21:56] Skylar Sanford: Okay. Found it.

[0:21:59] Benjamin  Kinard: So why wouldn't it just pull that up?

[0:22:01] Skylar Sanford: There's you know? Do you know how to log bugs? I do. Then why did you I'll do it for

[0:22:10] Benjamin  Kinard: you, actually. I'm trying to okay.

[0:22:12] Skylar Sanford: This this is one of those that's hard to log because you actually need a screenshot and talk through. So I'm actually just gonna share it directly at the

[0:22:17] Benjamin  Kinard: engineering team. Okay.

[0:22:18] Skylar Sanford: I got you. Night. Night.

[0:22:29] Benjamin  Kinard: See you tomorrow. I so I don't so now I'm seeing 77 results, and I don't see stat IO anymore.

[0:22:41] Skylar Sanford: Oh, here we go. Stat.

[0:23:38] Benjamin  Kinard: No. Jason mentioned You're right to call that out looking back at this transcript. Yes. He did. So dude was ecstatic about being able to pull up an entire company or a specific filtered data set and then chat with it.

[0:24:48] Benjamin  Kinard: He was so excited about that.

[0:24:49] Skylar Sanford: Yeah. A specific company?

[0:24:52] Benjamin  Kinard: Like it needs to be Well, he can do

[0:24:53] Skylar Sanford: that today.

[0:24:54] Benjamin  Kinard: I know. I know. Yeah. But your view and how much easier and cleaner it is Yeah. Future state, like, to be able to chat to that particular deal and all of its data without having to compile it or filter, like search for it.

[0:25:10] Benjamin  Kinard: Mhmm. You you just go to it. I don't know. It just seemed more like, that's our biggest complaint we keep getting is the UI and the UX versus, you know, the damn juggernaut.

[0:25:23] Skylar Sanford: I should not be as offended as I am when people say, you guys are just a damn notetaker. But the way we structure the data and present it, we're a fucking notetaker. No. I'm I'm well, I listen. I can be most critical here.

[0:25:38] Skylar Sanford: Okay. But I to your point, I'm I'm I'm plus one in here where I think what's highly missing is one. What's gonna be basically a table stake of what I'm building. Oh, let me show you. Now let me get to you my this isn't even No way.

[0:25:58] Skylar Sanford: Yeah, bro. We're we're, uh, I don't even wanna tell you what model that is. You'd be shocked.

[0:26:03] Benjamin  Kinard: No worries.

[0:26:04] Skylar Sanford: I'm actually I'm at this point, Ben, just trying to drive this thing till it crashes.

[0:26:10] Benjamin  Kinard: Here we go. I have an option. Oh, yeah?

[0:26:15] Skylar Sanford: I don't have a case. I have a cast.

[0:26:19] Benjamin  Kinard: Let's see. Wait. No. No. No.

[0:26:20] Benjamin  Kinard: No. You can

[0:26:20] Skylar Sanford: keep that. No. You can keep taking charge. You can charge with this. Oh, okay.

[0:26:23] Skylar Sanford: I don't want you to cut yourself

[0:26:23] Benjamin  Kinard: off of the glass. Glass. See if it's fence. No. I

[0:26:32] Skylar Sanford: actually have one. It stops charging.

[0:26:39] Benjamin  Kinard: There you go. Now you're charging. Let's go. I saw a problem. And you just dumped.

[0:26:49] Benjamin  Kinard: What were you saying?

[0:26:51] Skylar Sanford: What are what are we should say? I wanted to show you just some high level thinking around this to move. Get your. So where we initially want to build, it's different than release. We may need to stack a few builds before we actually do a bigger release.

[0:27:36] Skylar Sanford: I think that there's something about having tackling more personas at once upon release. James has been referring you to a rep workspace, which I really like that language Mhmm. Where you've your got book of business. You've you've got your your deals that you're carrying, and there's a lot more details to that. But I think what I'm deducing with a lot of complexity around, like, the journey stuff visualizing that is what this product is really doing is cutting through all the bullshit and just telling you what the freak you need to do.

[0:28:14] Benjamin  Kinard: It's eliminating a CRM.

[0:28:19] Skylar Sanford: This guy gets it. Yeah, that's what we're talking about. 100. So there's another visualization what I was talking about where here I'm in a customer. Here's the actual event history timeline.

[0:28:33] Skylar Sanford: So you have a rep workspace. But then, of course, you're gonna have an aggregate team view. So here's our manager with their team that they could see. Yeah. Love that you spit fired a bunch of things that you just want on that view.

[0:28:46] Skylar Sanford: Yeah. And then you're gonna have um, I think there's different team views here. Uh, what he had this idea of actually imagine you being able to see your team via calendar, but not just their calendar. What's because you can do that today with Google. But, like, what's missing is he says, I need to know which meetings are actually good meetings and which are bad yeah.

[0:29:10] Skylar Sanford: High value versus High potential

[0:29:11] Benjamin  Kinard: and high value as well as, like, weak sets versus strong.

[0:29:15] Skylar Sanford: Yeah. Is isn't there a world where, hey. Actually, you have no time today. Here's some low potential. Let's actually cancel that or move it and actually set that time aside for you to do these tasks because you have another deal that's good to close.

[0:29:31] Skylar Sanford: Well, they're waiting on a freaking contract, man. Oh, wow, dude. Wow. Anyways, obviously, higher level than team is you would have an organization aggregate view where you have more of

[0:29:45] Benjamin  Kinard: a high level, you know, number quota for revenue forecasting

[0:29:49] Skylar Sanford: you would have here. But, you know, each there's different teams that you can break down into there. Now where we wanna tack, this is all good stuff. I actually think a launch, we could have a very basic version of, like, the team level and then the organization level, but we wanna focus on like, let's give some workspace. So then I think on launch, you should be able to come in, see your reps.

[0:30:15] Skylar Sanford: Maybe there's not great action items ready for you yet, but you can be able to click in per rep and actually walk through. But they're gonna have this. This isn't just for you. It's obviously for them to. Tell me what you're what you're feeling.

[0:30:31] Benjamin  Kinard: You're feeling. Dude, it's just gonna be it's just so awesome. It's just so crazy. Like Yeah. The the oh, man.

[0:30:46] Benjamin  Kinard: Just automating that much more of, you know, where things break down. Like like, if if Canova had AI doing all of this for him. Like, you know, he still have a job. Like, all of this stuff that be

[0:31:07] Skylar Sanford: more detailed doing all of what?

[0:31:09] Benjamin  Kinard: Like, this customer's you just showed me something in the future state where the leader can move calendar events to say, hey, rep. Hey. The these meetings actually aren't that important. You have three customers waiting on you have three prospects waiting on follow Two are material and meaning collateral, or one is an agreement. You don't need to attend this meeting.

[0:31:34] Benjamin  Kinard: You need to knock those things out. Yeah. I mean, that's pretty I mean, if you have to micromanage people like that, that's that's a different story, different concern.
