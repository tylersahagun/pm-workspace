[0:00:00] Unknown Speaker 1: Thing. But what I think we should do genuinely is have, call it, product channel, which is simply a context window like the AskElephant description we have currently. Doesn't have to be that way. Preferably a better way. But some place where I can come and say for this product channel.

[0:00:14] Unknown Speaker 1: And the reason why I'm saying that phrase specifically is AskElephant only has one product, but we had different product channels. And so it fits that case. It also fits if I have a tool, like, let's pick one of Reduce ecommerce things. The way they roll it out for a company of 50 people versus 50,000 will be very different. And so it's different channels.

[0:00:35] Unknown Speaker 1: So I like, I think we're addressing by calling a product channel. One product that has different facets, also multiple products across the same, like, persona or facet, and then they can also separate it by persona if they want. I would not separate persona. I'd have the channel, and then within that channel, I'd say, these are the personas that we pitch to. These are the ways this product resonates with its persona, and that is all secondary to the baseline of this is what product actually is.

[0:00:58] Unknown Speaker 1: This is how it solves the problem. These are the problems it solves, whatever. So what the channel is, what the product how the product addresses that channel, what the pains are that it's solving, how the personas interpret, receive, and relate to or have this emotional connection to both those pains and the solutions, and then the messaging that has been successful across all of it. And once they have this, like, brain dump version of a draft, which we also probably should be able to pull from people's websites.

[0:01:23] Unknown Speaker 2: Not in other websites, but if they have done their calls for the last month, then we could, like, digest those. How sick of an experience would

[0:01:30] Unknown Speaker 1: that be? Exactly. Being able to draft all that. Now the keys for what you just outlined to be possible, we have to have an internal database or or table that lets us say, okay. This call, you talk about these things.

[0:01:42] Unknown Speaker 1: We think that's gonna be this product channel. And it starts to separate those things out And you're so can have the limited context that I then run analysis on.

[0:01:49] Unknown Speaker 2: And it should be ongoing. So that's part

[0:01:50] Unknown Speaker 1: of the

[0:01:51] Unknown Speaker 2: way that's learning is, hey.

[0:01:52] Unknown Speaker 1: There should be some things that learns and some that it has human override or learns differently. For example, if we're talking about product offerings, like, product offering hasn't really changed, but we've been able to pitch the forecasting piece because of builds. Before we update the, like, product section of that product channel, we should have it suggest a change because of what it's hearing on calls about forecasting, and that should get reviewed by some PM or channel manager or whatever you wanna call. I

[0:02:17] Unknown Speaker 2: don't care. Yeah. Well, there'd be some, yeah, human in the loop aspect,

[0:02:20] Unknown Speaker 1: but it'd be proactive. For other pieces that I don't think matter as much, like, what messaging is resonating with people. And then those product channels can influence, for example, a meeting prep and says, okay. You're jumping on with this client. They have expressed these things.

[0:02:34] Unknown Speaker 1: This is their persona. This is the messaging you should take. These are the pains they probably have that you should be scoping for. These are their, like, risks that are gonna come up in six months because it should also have all that stuff. There's a lot there.

[0:02:45] Unknown Speaker 1: I think it's freaking sick. It could be great. Not could be. This is fantastic.

[0:02:50] Unknown Speaker 2: K. The I think the breakthrough for

[0:02:52] Unknown Speaker 1: me is, like And what I'm outlining for design is more of a back end infrastructure and not the interface of the experience. So I don't what that needs to be.

[0:02:58] Unknown Speaker 2: I don't know I don't know exactly, but just structurally how I think about is, like, if you have some framework that it can just be there no matter what, like, this should be somewhat and they they could go make their own buckets too. They should have

[0:03:11] Unknown Speaker 1: this for every product channel, basically.

[0:03:12] Unknown Speaker 2: Always be here. And then if we just separate this from everything you said of all of the data, now what we're saying is because there's no way you could map everything. We're not trying to do that.

[0:03:22] Unknown Speaker 1: But if you say, like, hey. For You should map a lot, but go on.

[0:03:24] Unknown Speaker 2: But for this customer, given their persona, given the products that they're interested in, given everything they've said, their buying process, all of this, it's gonna go reference all of that and then it come back and say, for this customer, based off all of this, James, they still have not clearly articulated it. In a way that leads to close win because we know what that is.

[0:03:45] Unknown Speaker 1: Yes. And the piece that I think is important to highlight, our goal with this in my mind should be to fix what is actually a very hard chasm for reps to fix. Like, it is very hard for a rep to become an expert in more than one subset.

[0:04:01] Unknown Speaker 2: Like I mean, we don't have different products, but to your point, we don't pitch the right personas enough because we don't

[0:04:06] Unknown Speaker 1: have expertise here.

[0:04:07] Unknown Speaker 2: And I'm That's very similar.

[0:04:08] Unknown Speaker 1: I'm not as good as I should be at it. Like, I'm just not.

[0:04:11] Unknown Speaker 2: I suck at pitching rev ops. I know that.

[0:04:14] Unknown Speaker 1: I I feel like I can pitch most personas pretty well, but I'm like, I wouldn't give myself a 10 in any of them except for maybe rev ops. Yeah. Like, I'm a a seven at best probably in implementations and sales managers. CROs, if I can probably an eight. But, Mike, that is a shortcoming and the only way I'm gonna get better because I'm I'm also not gonna spend the time to get better at those ones either.

[0:04:36] Unknown Speaker 1: Like, just being real. Yeah. And most reps aren't gonna spend the time I've spent. And so, like, this kind of thing should be designed in a way to make those reps I don't know what the phrase is for anything other than guns, but, like, shoot better than the gun. It's outperform what they are qualified to.

[0:04:54] Unknown Speaker 2: Well, to say it differently, like, it would break down the barrier of, like, expertise needed because it would bring everything to you where the the the actual sales skills are what is important versus a lack of expertise.

[0:05:07] Unknown Speaker 1: And you know what else? For a lot of people, simply showing, hey. This what is it says all the stuff is. This is what it's saying your risks are. These are the pain.

[0:05:14] Unknown Speaker 1: Like, you could literally just show that

[0:05:15] Unknown Speaker 2: 100%.

[0:05:16] Unknown Speaker 1: And move to the next point of then have a self guided sales process is the second piece of this. But, like, showing that to a person on their third call, you know, like, it seems like we haven't actually hit the nail on the head because of x, y, and z. Is that accurate? Almost certain they'll say yes. They'll see what pains they have left and how we fix it.

[0:05:33] Unknown Speaker 1: And if AskElephant has some AI generated video or PowerPoint form there on that call, that's a freaking good sales experience,

[0:05:41] Unknown Speaker 2: I think. Like, even if you showed your screen and be like, hey. This is how I knew how to do this. Do you want your reps to

[0:05:45] Unknown Speaker 1: be able

[0:05:45] Unknown Speaker 2: to it?

[0:05:46] Unknown Speaker 1: Like, just like heads up. I'd like we're outside of my threshold, my my realm of expertise, so we're just gonna show you this. Yeah. I like it a lot. I think it could be good.

[0:05:55] Unknown Speaker 2: K. Thank you.

[0:05:57] Unknown Speaker 1: Good brain dump.

[0:05:58] Unknown Speaker 2: Anything else you would put in the brain dump? The fuzzy part for me is still how do you We should be able at things and how do you map to some extent, but then also have the ability for AI to make the connections that

[0:06:12] Unknown Speaker 1: it just it's gonna have to I I really do think having so flow of data in this case. I think, one, there you need a person, or you could have AI try to make a a rough guess, but it should have a a person loop a lot of some admin setting up their product channels. These are your product channels, and we can pull from the website, whatever else to get the baseline Mhmm. For those. Once that's set, we should have a not just a single block of text, but, like, different sections, a product fit, paints Mhmm.

[0:06:41] Unknown Speaker 1: Like, personas, persona message, whatever, as a subset of all those things. And then it's like you have a person do that. Then you have a table that references all those and pulls from calls and gives you data kinda like our personas today. Mhmm. We're just dumping all this stuff.

[0:06:57] Unknown Speaker 1: And then you have another one that's either daily, weekly, monthly, whatever, looking at all those updates, comparing it to table, making suggestions or improvements, or just changing some that are within its threshold to change. And then

[0:07:08] Unknown Speaker 2: Mhmm. I see what you're saying. It's storing throughout the month or whatever time period so that then it could aggregate that and present changes

[0:07:14] Unknown Speaker 1: or just make changes. Your source of truth

[0:07:16] Unknown Speaker 2: Yep.

[0:07:17] Unknown Speaker 1: Which is the channels, the the part that you are putting a stamp on saying this is done. It's like when I build you a revenue engine. Yep. Then you have all the data points that would tell you if it's an accurate source of truth or if it needs to tweak. But that's just in the background.

[0:07:29] Unknown Speaker 1: It's Call in the background.

[0:07:29] Unknown Speaker 2: Aggregated on every single

[0:07:30] Unknown Speaker 1: call, every email. Admin experience. Yep. And then the client experience or rep experience should be, I log into my thing. It gives me specific blip that says, this is who this person is.

[0:07:43] Unknown Speaker 1: This is their product channel. This is the messaging you need to hit. This is what you've already done. This is the gap. This should be the goal of your next call.

[0:07:50] Unknown Speaker 2: Here's a here's a case study that the the closest customer that if you needed to, like, bring it up, here's how they went from x to nine.

[0:07:57] Unknown Speaker 1: Exactly. Yeah.

[0:07:59] Unknown Speaker 2: All of that is right

[0:08:00] Unknown Speaker 1: there and is presented to you guys. That's a good experience. That's a phenomenal experience. Agreed. Absolutely agree.

[0:08:08] Unknown Speaker 2: That that's, like, world changing or

[0:08:10] Unknown Speaker 1: Yeah. In our world, obviously. Now I wanna add a second piece. AskElephant doesn't do today. Have I told you yet I want AskElephant to merge with the company like Gamma.

[0:08:18] Unknown Speaker 1: In intelligence later? Oh, that was Gamma two? Like, there's a second piece to all this of data points. Once we actually have a CRM replacement, we're gonna have to have ways to house close one deals or whatever. Somewhat someone's paying us ARR kind of things.

[0:08:32] Unknown Speaker 1: Like, we need we need ways to import that kind of data, and then we can also have a whole lot of other points where we could highlight, hey, your close rate is lower here. It seems like our channels are wrong, or none of the reps are executing what the channel is saying. Yep. Like, there's there's a lot on there that we Oh, you're just

[0:08:49] Unknown Speaker 2: it's not like that more macro level?

[0:08:51] Unknown Speaker 1: We need actual data analytics.

[0:08:53] Unknown Speaker 2: A 100%. Like That comes once we have that data, though. Right? Like, I

[0:08:56] Unknown Speaker 1: think it's, like,

[0:08:56] Unknown Speaker 2: part one, part two, unless you disagree.

[0:09:00] Unknown Speaker 1: From where we're at now, I don't, but it doesn't have to be. Like, for if we had $50,000,000 today, I would say you are think we

[0:09:07] Unknown Speaker 2: build the constraints. Yeah. Yeah. I think you could build them simultaneously.

[0:09:11] Unknown Speaker 1: That that's part of like, yes. They they're actually very separate. They talk to each other, and there's a lot of overlap of the goals that they help try to solve. But, like, standard analytics are still gonna I could solve their closure problem, I think, with standard analytics, not using AskElephant. AskElephant will solve it in ways that is more practical for a rep.

[0:09:29] Unknown Speaker 1: Whereas I can just go to somebody like, hey. When you have these reps on these products, your closure rates drop a lot because there's, like, expertise issues probably. I can make that assumption, spot check 10 calls, and see if it's true or not. Like, that's the way I would go about it today.

[0:09:42] Unknown Speaker 2: And if that was automated also with the AskElephant and it's all in one

[0:09:45] Unknown Speaker 1: That's what that second subset of is.

[0:09:46] Unknown Speaker 2: No. A 100%. Yeah. Yeah. If with the current resources, though, it's like a part one, part two.

[0:09:52] Unknown Speaker 1: Yes. Agreed. See, this is the future that

[0:09:56] Unknown Speaker 2: I like. Let's bring it not to the future.

[0:09:59] Unknown Speaker 1: Let's bring

[0:10:00] Unknown Speaker 2: it now.

[0:10:01] Unknown Speaker 1: $50,000,000.
