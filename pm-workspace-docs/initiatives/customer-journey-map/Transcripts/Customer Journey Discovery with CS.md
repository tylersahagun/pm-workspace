[0:00:01] Skylar Sanford: So in a nutshell, I'm trying to solve two things upfront is, one, our users know exactly where the customer is at in the journey. Mhmm. And let's just quickly define journey, how we think of it. Other tools or companies will think of pre sales journey, the sales Mhmm. Process, post sales process.

[0:00:30] Skylar Sanford: We wanna think of a customer journey as just one single journey. Okay. And then sometimes you loop back as you resell products. So there's the whole aspect of also multi threading, and then multi deals, and then going back. So it's the the whole journey itself is quite dynamic.

[0:00:46] Skylar Sanford: Mhmm. A customer should be able to know exactly where their customer's at in that journey, and it's not a point Our

[0:00:54] Jasmin Beckwith: customers should know where their customers are?

[0:00:57] Skylar Sanford: Yes.

[0:00:57] Jasmin Beckwith: Okay.

[0:00:58] Skylar Sanford: I know it can get confusing.

[0:00:59] Jasmin Beckwith: I just wanna make sure I understand.

[0:01:00] Skylar Sanford: 100%. Let me rephrase it. You guys will know exactly where your clients are Okay. In the journey. Gotcha.

[0:01:09] Skylar Sanford: Because that's actually why I'm talking to you guys. Because, obviously, CS is a big part of that. I would say the majority part of this customer journey. I see the sales process as a smaller point in time and process, of course, when you're comparing. So knowing where they're at is great, but the other part that needs to be true is that reps, and I say reps more generally for CS and sales, they know exactly what they need to be doing to make impact to progress those customers.

[0:01:40] Parker Alexander: Yeah.

[0:01:41] Skylar Sanford: So is it a fair statement that even with you guys on post sales, there's always, like, a next outcome that you're trying to push for your clients? Always.

[0:01:50] Parker Alexander: Yeah. Or build upon. Yeah. Or, like, when we wrap up one of the outcomes and say, cool. Mission accomplished.

[0:01:58] Parker Alexander: What net what's next?

[0:01:59] Skylar Sanford: Talk to me about that. Like, what next? Give me some examples. Some recent ones, maybe.

[0:02:05] Jasmin Beckwith: Do you have one? Because I do.

[0:02:08] Parker Alexander: Yeah. Go ahead.

[0:02:12] Jasmin Beckwith: An outcome that we can typically look at is that we start to shift our language towards instead of being like, what are manual things that you want us to do? It's been what is the outcome, and it's a lot of it is time. Saving time is a big one on the CS side. Time for sales would be, like, shortening deal increasing deal velocity or and that's the kind of time. It's not so much saving them time as much as it is shortening the time to close.

[0:02:42] Jasmin Beckwith: Yes. Whereas CS, it's, like, their their own physical time of, like, I need help me get more time in my day. And so for that, for, like, CS, it's, okay. What are the systems that we can put into place that will help us achieve that outcome of save time, which for CS is, like, meeting preps or recap emails or putting notes sometimes in HubSpot if that's something that they

[0:03:11] Parker Alexander: need to put. Yeah. Hubs CRM automation.

[0:03:13] Jasmin Beckwith: CRM. Those are, like, the three main things that feed into saving time. There might be something nuanced for the company or industry. Once we achieve that, then it's the next outcome after that is then maybe moving to something that's more nuanced. Or if we continue on the thread of saving time, it's then holding that pattern.

[0:03:35] Jasmin Beckwith: The next kind of phase is we've achieved this outcome or the systems for this outcome. It's a testing period to make sure that like, a refinement period to make sure that, like, we are achieving that. And if we are, then it's scoping out for, okay, now that that's been reduced, now what is the next thing that you are repetitively doing that we could make a completely autonomous Yeah. To continue kind of that length initial outcome of saving time.

[0:04:01] Skylar Sanford: Yeah. So at a high level saving time is a big thing they want. Is there other types of, like, needle mover things? Like

[0:04:09] Parker Alexander: I think for like, one of the conversations that I've had more frequently lately is, like, I'll talk to people and, for example, Motivasi is what comes to mind. But I've done similar things with other customers where we accomplish something, but there's this big goal or big task or whatever that they want automated. And I say, okay. What's next? And they're like, why?

[0:04:33] Parker Alexander: Have no idea. Right? And so what my talk track has been recently is like, hey. We focused a lot on the individual contributors and what they're putting into, like, their effort metrics, their time, their energy, their value, whatever. Tiers.

[0:04:50] Parker Alexander: And then talk saying, cool. We've accomplished that. Now, like, let's zoom out and say, you're on a rev op you're on rev ops or you're on leadership. Like, we have these automations there for for you. The AskElephant is get like, listening, and it has all of those insights available.

[0:05:07] Parker Alexander: We need to tell them tell AskElephant what to pull out so that leadership Mhmm. Can also see the value on impact on their day to

[0:05:15] Skylar Sanford: day. Okay.

[0:05:16] Parker Alexander: Because the last thing a VP of sales or a CRO or head of CX wants to do is go in and audit calls. Right? So type kinda zooming back out and saying what types of reporting insights are are valuable to you as a business leader Mhmm. That we can showcase.

[0:05:35] Skylar Sanford: Yeah. That would be me.

[0:05:37] Parker Alexander: Like, oh, Jazz always asks this type of questions. She's killing it. Parker's missing the mark on this consistently. How do we close the gap? Right?

[0:05:45] Parker Alexander: And so helping the visibility be there for leadership so that they can make those business decisions that are impactful Yeah. Based on actual things, not just yeah. Well, I think that this rep's not doing well, so we should get rid of them. It's like, well, the rep's doing really well, but they're missing on this thing.

[0:06:02] Skylar Sanford: Let's coach do it. Yeah.

[0:06:05] Jasmin Beckwith: So I have two thoughts. One is I've been explaining it as, like, three tiers to, like, look at the systems at

[0:06:12] Skylar Sanford: k.

[0:06:13] Jasmin Beckwith: Which is the easiest one that we typically will look at is the system of that anything that's manual or a mental

[0:06:20] Skylar Sanford: load. Mhmm.

[0:06:21] Jasmin Beckwith: And it usually is affecting an individual contributor, sometimes a manager.

[0:06:24] Skylar Sanford: Yep.

[0:06:25] Jasmin Beckwith: The next kind of system that we wanna look at for an outcome is the reporting side.

[0:06:30] Skylar Sanford: Yeah.

[0:06:30] Jasmin Beckwith: This is mostly for manager executives. Mhmm. It can be for an IC, but most of the time it's this. And the reporting is, like, sales alignment or methodology, ICP, how many deals, blah blah blah. This is product feedback.

[0:06:45] Jasmin Beckwith: This is, like, expansion opportunities. Right? Like Yeah. All of that. The next is aggregation, meaning trend lines across time.

[0:06:55] Jasmin Beckwith: And instead of telling me what happened on the trend lines, tell me what I want to do what I need to do next based off of what I've told you.

[0:07:02] Skylar Sanford: Bingo. Yeah.

[0:07:02] Jasmin Beckwith: So it's we've been talking about it in this way of, of, like, to help them understand the systems

[0:07:08] Parker Alexander: Mhmm.

[0:07:08] Jasmin Beckwith: And, like, the outcomes that they need to be looking for to help them move from this, which is really easy

[0:07:14] Skylar Sanford: Yeah.

[0:07:15] Jasmin Beckwith: To all of these other things, but understanding they're like, oh, this would be cool to have. Okay. But what is the outcome that we're trying to get? Because unless it changes a behavior or helps you achieve outcomes that you are responsible for, it's only a cool thing, and then it just becomes noise.

[0:07:31] Skylar Sanford: Yeah. Totally. So okay. So One six.

[0:07:34] Jasmin Beckwith: With that, we've been focusing on time to value first time to value.

[0:07:39] Skylar Sanford: Yeah.

[0:07:39] Jasmin Beckwith: And so these are all of the big things for, like, AEs is deal velocity, win rate, or close close rate, rate, time saved, ICP alignment, or likely to close percentages. CSMs, it's term prevention expansion. Time saved is their big one, and customer retention. Enablement, it's operational scaling, process consistency, and reporting accuracy. Solutions or implementation.

[0:08:05] Jasmin Beckwith: It's their own customer's time to value and hand up quality and the efficiency of the ramp period. And then rev ops, it's usually forecasting accuracy, pipeline health, revenue revenue trends. And then I have

[0:08:20] Skylar Sanford: Wait. Pause. This is incredible. That page right here. Yep.

[0:08:27] Skylar Sanford: I think you're helping me I wanna create a system where it'll actually help you track all of that.

[0:08:35] Jasmin Beckwith: Yeah. Because that would be really useful. If we so, essentially, how this would be helpful. If these are if these truly are their main things.

[0:08:42] Skylar Sanford: Like, you go to a customer and you basically see, like, a home dashboard for that customer that's like this, and then you actually see

[0:08:50] Jasmin Beckwith: Mhmm.

[0:08:50] Skylar Sanford: Progress for each of those and where you're at and very clear next steps. Yeah. But most importantly, and this is wanna see if you this statement resonates with you is like, sure, the ins and outs of where they're at in the stage is whatever, but it's like, help me, AskElephant. Just cut through like so much of the complexity and bullshit. Just help me know what I freaking need to do.

[0:09:10] Skylar Sanford: Mhmm. But even more so, AskElephant is gonna do a lot of those things. Oh, you need to send under contract, or you need follow-up with this person. Like, AskElephant can do those things, and then it's just a

[0:09:21] Jasmin Beckwith: Approving

[0:09:22] Skylar Sanford: Correct. Do that. Exactly.

[0:09:23] Jasmin Beckwith: The other thing I think that would be really helpful then is that not just coming through the bullshit, but then also telling me, like, based off of other customers and what because this is just what we've thought of. Mhmm. But what if there's something else going then comparing of, like, what are other things that maybe are outside of this that somebody has brought up that then we can implement and copy that workflow because it would be useful here?

[0:09:50] Skylar Sanford: Yeah. I

[0:09:52] Jasmin Beckwith: mean, I know that's kind of, like, next level. The main thing is just first level would probably be just being able to track where we are.

[0:09:59] Skylar Sanford: Yeah. For your guys' side, obviously, when you I'm trying to help me understand, like, the CS stages. And I know that one of those stages is gonna have a lot to it. Is it, like, onboarding

[0:10:20] Parker Alexander: and then just lifetime success and you start working on those things? Implementation slash onboarding training.

[0:10:29] Jasmin Beckwith: That all, like

[0:10:29] Parker Alexander: Get all kinda, like So I don't know

[0:10:31] Skylar Sanford: if a multiple

[0:10:32] Parker Alexander: stages necessarily in there. Yeah. And then, yeah, success. Like

[0:10:36] Skylar Sanford: And then just success is

[0:10:38] Jasmin Beckwith: but it's So, like, sometimes these outcomes are what we're focusing on in onboarding

[0:10:43] Parker Alexander: Yeah.

[0:10:43] Jasmin Beckwith: Which is the transition that we've been trying to make with sales of, like, hey. Try and think of outcomes Mhmm. In a system. So then instead of just, hey. That would be really cool to have.

[0:10:54] Jasmin Beckwith: Like, think of an outcome that we can work towards because sometimes how the customer has comes to us initially has been, oh, this is the outcome I want. But this is they aren't even thinking of the outcome. They've just been, like, subverting that of, like, no. This is the workflow I want. And I'm like, well, why do we want it?

[0:11:12] Jasmin Beckwith: Because this is the outcome. Well, actually, there's a lot better ways to have building blocks to get to this rather than this very complicated

[0:11:19] Skylar Sanford: block. Perfectly described how we think about product as well. Yes. Because care about that because we can figure

[0:11:26] Jasmin Beckwith: out how to cut corners. Walked away, but I would I would say, go ask Matt. How many times have I been like, Matt, I know it's broken when they want it that way, but that's what the customer wants, and that's how we have to build it.

[0:11:37] Skylar Sanford: Sure.

[0:11:38] Jasmin Beckwith: Is there a better way of doing it? Yes. I know there is, Matt, but that's not what we're doing here.

[0:11:42] Parker Alexander: Right.

[0:11:42] Jasmin Beckwith: And so we're trying to transition of sell them on an outcome, not a workflow so that we, as the experts

[0:11:49] Skylar Sanford: I know.

[0:11:50] Jasmin Beckwith: Can tell them this is the best way to get to where you want by having these building blocks, which inadvertently are small time first time to value milestones that we can very easily check off.

[0:12:01] Skylar Sanford: I would love a place on our website where we have a customer after a year they've been with us, and you literally have that page, x customer, and we actually show all these qualities and, like, how we've bumped up Mhmm. All 20 of those of those elements.

[0:12:17] Jasmin Beckwith: The only problem with this is that we unlike other products, at CS, we have to facilitate that conversation, and they have to tell us how we've changed that because we don't actually know how

[0:12:29] Parker Alexander: to track.

[0:12:29] Skylar Sanford: I was gonna say the quantifying is gonna be difficult. Yeah.

[0:12:31] Jasmin Beckwith: Yeah. Yeah. Like, other things that

[0:12:33] Skylar Sanford: are actually tracking

[0:12:34] Jasmin Beckwith: that, we all like, our PPRs have to be a facilitation, not a, here, I'm gonna show you the ROI. They have to give that to us in order for us to actually tie it. And so in that way, it really we become experts in the systems part, but, otherwise, it has to be a partnership. They have to tell us the feedback.

[0:12:56] Parker Alexander: Yeah. And I don't know, like, I don't know if we could ever, like, ethically get to a point where we can be like, oh, no. Like, your Salesforce actually says since you signed up for us, your revenue's increased or whatever. Like, your time to value or your your deal cycle is

[0:13:14] Jasmin Beckwith: short. Correct? Impersonate in that.

[0:13:16] Parker Alexander: Like, well, no. That's what I'm saying. Like, if there's something in the in the customer journey that, like, showcases that of, like, hey, this these are the metrics and here's what we're tracking. So what here's where we're at. Like, I know that's that would be North Star.

[0:13:31] Parker Alexander: For us, it's the only way to do that is plug into their HubSpot or Salesforce and pull that data. Yeah. And I don't think customers would necessarily

[0:13:40] Jasmin Beckwith: want to Yeah. Do

[0:13:43] Skylar Sanford: Ground cinnamon on your desk?

[0:13:45] Parker Alexander: Yeah. Put it in my coffee.

[0:13:47] Skylar Sanford: Yeah. Very smart. That makes sense. Okay. I wanna shift towards what a typical day looks like for each of you.

[0:14:00] Skylar Sanford: Janice, how my only assumption is that you are gonna have things on your calendar Mhmm. That's gonna kinda dictate your day. How do you know what's actually important to work on each day?

[0:14:16] Jasmin Beckwith: So I do a lot of time blocking

[0:14:18] Skylar Sanford: K.

[0:14:19] Jasmin Beckwith: To help with that. A lot of that is so if I have time blocks, that would initially I do it by order of importance.

[0:14:28] Skylar Sanford: K. And and, of just a mental tracking, just kind of a game sense

[0:14:33] Jasmin Beckwith: thing? To, like, help me make sure that I'm taking care of stuff. We're also transitioning into what we use to track our tasks and to dos.

[0:14:41] Skylar Sanford: Which was?

[0:14:42] Jasmin Beckwith: We were using client success, which wasn't great in my opinion, and now we're transitioning to

[0:14:48] Parker Alexander: HubSpot. HubSpot.

[0:14:50] Skylar Sanford: Oh, that sounded defeating.

[0:14:52] Parker Alexander: No. I'm sorry. I'm good with it.

[0:14:54] Jasmin Beckwith: Because we can actually, from AskElephant, speak directly to HubSpot and speak directly to Notion. So I built a Notion page. K. I don't feel. But project management of all my clients and their status and expansion.

[0:15:13] Jasmin Beckwith: And then you can click in. You can click into it, and then it would have all of their milestones. And when you can click into the milestone, it would have all the different tasks. So, like, at any given time, everybody can see all of that.

[0:15:26] Skylar Sanford: That's kinda what I wanna build. Mhmm. Click into one of those again.

[0:15:30] Parker Alexander: I haven't built them all out, but I can

[0:15:32] Jasmin Beckwith: build out the framework data.

[0:15:33] Skylar Sanford: If you had unlimited kind of magic wand to design this, we'll call it a customer dashboard. Yeah. Talk me through what's important here.

[0:15:41] Jasmin Beckwith: So these are kind of like what you were talking about as far as, like, the outcomes. So, like, the phase or the milestone would be the outcome.

[0:15:51] Skylar Sanford: K.

[0:15:51] Jasmin Beckwith: And then we would have from here are where the tasks will be, and these are the tasks dashboards would be then tied to a a particular outcome, and it would be, like, what is it that we're working on towards that. The order of importance is gonna be, for me, because I'm enterprise, is gonna be based on what is the due date, what is the timeline of the project date that we have Code. Coupled with is it actually is it just maintaining the account or is it for revenue?

[0:16:22] Skylar Sanford: And is maintaining more priority?

[0:16:24] Jasmin Beckwith: No. Revenues. In the sense of expansion.

[0:16:27] Skylar Sanford: K. An

[0:16:28] Jasmin Beckwith: increase in revenue. Like, if Right. This project done, they will increase Yes. That's the

[0:16:33] Skylar Sanford: If you do this other project to save them, you just save them, but you've not increased their revenue.

[0:16:36] Jasmin Beckwith: Yeah. And I guess save is the other one. Like, is it an at risk account?

[0:16:41] Skylar Sanford: Oh, sorry. I missed that. When you said okay. So Maintain risk, maintain, grow, really,

[0:16:45] Parker Alexander: is the

[0:16:46] Jasmin Beckwith: It's kind of the three stages that we have.

[0:16:48] Parker Alexander: Yeah. And

[0:16:50] Jasmin Beckwith: order of importance is going to be between, like, save and grow is kind of gonna be coupled by, like, is this an ongoing issue? Can we actually be saved if we do this one thing? Or is it, like, how big the account is also? So there's gonna be couple that, and there sometimes they just might be shared in parallel depending on the account.

[0:17:15] Skylar Sanford: Sure. So That's how,

[0:17:18] Jasmin Beckwith: like, I manage my days going off of this. So, like, if something from agility comes in, if I don't have anything else, I'll do it. But if something from Boostly or Dental Intel comes in or Disruptive, that takes priority.

[0:17:35] Skylar Sanford: Uh, why?

[0:17:37] Jasmin Beckwith: Uh, one, because Boostly and, uh, Dental Intel are paying more. Dental Intel is also I know right now we're kind of in a save because they're comparing us to Gong and gonna be making a decision at January. And disruptive is it's been tenuous, and they've really wanted this one thing, and there's opportunity for expansion. We've just not been able to kinda close that deal.

[0:18:01] Skylar Sanford: Now, obviously, because you're good at your job, you're able to hold on to all that context and be able to make judgment calls of what's important.

[0:18:07] Jasmin Beckwith: Mhmm. But how do I see that in how do I put that into a

[0:18:13] Skylar Sanford: Is that even needed? Is that even like, how obviously, there's a customer value is what we're talking about. Yeah. There's a there's a there's a hidden score here of ranking of of value. And I'm just trying to think if that's something that is of need to help visualize that or display that.

[0:18:30] Jasmin Beckwith: I think

[0:18:31] Skylar Sanford: And not just for you, obviously, for scale for all CS.

[0:18:34] Jasmin Beckwith: I think for scale, yes. Because the idea is that with AskElephant, typically for enterprise, you might have no more than 20 or 30. 30 is actually really pushing it.

[0:18:46] Parker Alexander: For customers? For customers.

[0:18:48] Jasmin Beckwith: For enterprise. Because enterprise should be, like, the biggest of the big. And from enterprise, you treat each department or team as its own customer. So, really,

[0:19:01] Skylar Sanford: I

[0:19:01] Parker Alexander: might have

[0:19:01] Skylar Sanford: 30 sales. There's ops. There's

[0:19:03] Jasmin Beckwith: Because of each division within a company.

[0:19:06] Parker Alexander: K.

[0:19:07] Jasmin Beckwith: So at any given point, it can be overwhelming. Using AskElephant, it should increase my capacity to have more clients, like, to 30. Meaning,

[0:19:15] Skylar Sanford: I might have,

[0:19:15] Jasmin Beckwith: like, sixty, ninety clients, in which case, I'm not gonna be able to memorize all of that. I will need something to

[0:19:22] Skylar Sanford: That's where this that's that's where you're able to scale your capacity is because you can now offload the mental tracking and rely on the system to track it.

[0:19:30] Parker Alexander: Yeah. And that's I mean, that's how I approach it too. It's like, I don't have to take meticulous notes while I'm on a call, obviously, because AskElephant can service that. So I have, like, especially before any given call, I put prep time on my calendar to make sure that I

[0:19:49] Skylar Sanford: Yeah. Know exactly what I need to do.

[0:19:51] Parker Alexander: I'm also at the end of the day, like, depending on when my last call is, it's like, cool. What are the action items that I need to do for the calls that I just had?

[0:19:59] Skylar Sanford: Yeah. Right. So if

[0:20:01] Parker Alexander: there's workflows I need to

[0:20:02] Skylar Sanford: build out, submit reserve, like, the last couple hours of your day for no calls so you can do that? No.

[0:20:10] Parker Alexander: It would be great

[0:20:11] Skylar Sanford: if I could, though. You just kind of

[0:20:12] Parker Alexander: It's

[0:20:12] Skylar Sanford: not logistically possible. Is that because getting on a call is just ultimately just more important for your day? Absolutely. If you had a budget for your day, it's like, calls will take priority.

[0:20:26] Parker Alexander: Absolutely. Yeah. Like, if I could be on and there's days that I've been on, like,

[0:20:31] Skylar Sanford: six calls back to back to back.

[0:20:33] Parker Alexander: Yes. I'm exhausted at the end of the day. Yeah. But I also know AskElephant's there, keeping track of what we talk so that I can make I can make sure that those things are done.

[0:20:44] Jasmin Beckwith: Yeah. Because at with that capacity aspect, then why have a CSM? Like, that's been asked before, like, for customer status of, like so you're saying I don't need CSMs? And I'm like, no. Because CSMs shouldn't be just people who you don't need to do anything and the machine does everything.

[0:21:04] Jasmin Beckwith: Otherwise, why have a CSM? What it should be is that then Parker can focus on, okay. What is the point of this call, and are we achieving that point instead of I'm reading from a script because this could have been an email? Tell

[0:21:20] Skylar Sanford: me give me some more okay. Let's brainstorm on this. I love this idea of, like, where I I lost the exact wording in my head, but what are those human elements that, um, AskElephant shouldn't be offloading? Like, uh, I think I think it's fair to say that we like, everyone would want a human and not a not a bot

[0:21:47] Parker Alexander: You're the bot.

[0:21:48] Skylar Sanford: To be CS. As a CS. Mhmm. Yeah. So just as a interesting thought, but, like, what are those human elements that are, like, key there?

[0:21:56] Jasmin Beckwith: For me, it's North Star alignment. People are we by humans, are really dumb and get distracted very easily. And so a lot of times, what my what the strategic initiative is is I have to realign them to the to what the north star is. And the reason for that is because that's how I prove that we have value.

[0:22:20] Skylar Sanford: Yeah.

[0:22:20] Jasmin Beckwith: If we go off of here, that was a nice to have. That's not proving value. That's proving nice to have. And so a lot of times, the strategic initiative that I have to make sure that we're doing that I'm doing is realigning and tying everything back to that North Star.

[0:22:35] Skylar Sanford: And our jobs have very similar to us.

[0:22:37] Jasmin Beckwith: Well, because sometimes I mean, there is a lot

[0:22:39] Parker Alexander: of Yeah. People just, like, lose the plot sometimes.

[0:22:41] Skylar Sanford: Yeah. Yeah.

[0:22:42] Parker Alexander: And, like, scope creep is a thing. Mhmm. And you like, I know you were talking with dental until last week, and they were saying things that, like, Gong does. And you're like, we do those things. You should know that we do those things.

[0:22:57] Parker Alexander: And it's like, oh, where are we missing block? I think that's one thing that, like, you can't just automate is that type of conversation of, hey. Will you guys like, we need this, this, and this. Yeah. We absolutely do that.

[0:23:11] Skylar Sanford: Yeah. We

[0:23:12] Parker Alexander: just didn't know. Either we didn't know or we changed priorities or we shifted. So there needs to be that level of realignment.

[0:23:18] Jasmin Beckwith: A lot of it also is in the moment decisions Yeah. Which AskElephant doesn't do, which is, oh, you made mention of something. Instead of glossing it over, a lot of my job is to constantly be thinking, what else can I discover? What else can I unearth? What else?

[0:23:33] Jasmin Beckwith: What else? Mhmm. And so I constantly have to be on the lookout for, okay. You mentioned this. Yeah.

[0:23:39] Jasmin Beckwith: Why did that change? Well, because of this. So what initiated that person to want to do that? Where it constantly, like in other words, it could be like, oh, hey. We decided to change our CS team from more CS to, like, they're in charge of revenue now, and they have KPIs.

[0:23:57] Jasmin Beckwith: Okay. Cool. That's nice to know. Mhmm. No.

[0:24:01] Jasmin Beckwith: What initiated that change,

[0:24:03] Skylar Sanford: Propeller? Deeper.

[0:24:05] Jasmin Beckwith: Oh, it's because our our we haven't been selling as great, and so we've actually

[0:24:09] Parker Alexander: class is doing the same thing.

[0:24:10] Jasmin Beckwith: Or we haven't been retain retaining as much. Oh, interesting. How did you discover that? Oh, interesting. Because, typically, there's something there that I can uncover to then make a new outcome.

[0:24:22] Skylar Sanford: Yep.

[0:24:22] Jasmin Beckwith: Would it be useful? Would it be valuable if AskElephant could help you achieve this outcome? Oh, well, yeah.

[0:24:29] Skylar Sanford: Can we

[0:24:29] Jasmin Beckwith: do that? Yes. Yes. We can.

[0:24:32] Skylar Sanford: So so this goes back to earlier my thought where the sales process is almost very predefined. And there's a lot of routes to get there. Sure. But success seems so open ended where it's like, what success is completely dynamic to what the customer needs, but it relies on you doing that investigation to figure out where we can make impact. Yeah.

[0:24:54] Skylar Sanford: And What was the word you said?

[0:24:58] Jasmin Beckwith: No. No.

[0:24:59] Skylar Sanford: Or no? I don't know.

[0:25:01] Jasmin Beckwith: I don't know. I

[0:25:02] Parker Alexander: don't know.

[0:25:02] Skylar Sanford: Another word like investigating. Anyways

[0:25:05] Parker Alexander: yeah. No. But to your point, like, that's been a hard thing for me because I've been full cycle sales up until this job. Like, I've I've been hunt like, cold calling, demoing, selling, trialing, like Yeah. And also account managing once they become customers.

[0:25:20] Parker Alexander: But the North Star for me and my roles has always been revenue.

[0:25:24] Skylar Sanford: Mhmm. Right? Cool.

[0:25:25] Parker Alexander: Like, these are your existing customers.

[0:25:27] Jasmin Beckwith: Grow

[0:25:28] Parker Alexander: them. And, like, I'm still growing them. Like, I'm a I'm an expansion CSM. Yeah. But it's not, like, shifting my mindset of there always needs to be an open opportunity or deal

[0:25:39] Skylar Sanford: or else I don't need

[0:25:40] Parker Alexander: to continue to talk to them. Mhmm. Because that's where my focus should be Yep. Instead of, like, oh, no. Like, I need to talk to all of these clients even though they're not actively like, we don't have a 10 c

[0:25:51] Skylar Sanford: deal pending.

[0:25:52] Parker Alexander: But if we knock this out, we prove this out, that's gonna set them so them up for growth in the future because we're gonna accomplish this

[0:26:00] Jasmin Beckwith: this month.

[0:26:00] Skylar Sanford: Yeah. If he's

[0:26:01] Jasmin Beckwith: if so we're doing the exact same thing, but his north star is if they are successful, it should equal expansion. Mhmm. My north star is if they are successful, it should equal renewals consistently and and natural growth. Correct.

[0:26:18] Skylar Sanford: Customer had worded to me this way that really CS is all about re increasing the chances of renewal or reducing the risk of churn. Mhmm. It's really, like, the main thing. I I have a hard stop. This it's actually really insightful.

[0:26:37] Jasmin Beckwith: Okay.

[0:26:37] Skylar Sanford: Good. Intentionally didn't I intentionally didn't have, like, a set narrative path, but going into how you guys work, I wanna come pick your brain later time to some questions. Okay. It makes me feel like the whole, like, k. Where can we make expansion?

[0:26:50] Skylar Sanford: I feel like there should be a system, which you guys probably already leveraging in some ways where if you go into your customer, they should be able to, like, based off of all the data, find that nuance and be like, hey, I think that this might be an opportunity right here or something for you to double click into. Lot of

[0:27:07] Jasmin Beckwith: it is gonna be timing. That's the other big thing of

[0:27:09] Skylar Sanford: our job is timing. Oh, yeah.

[0:27:12] Jasmin Beckwith: Like, yeah, there might be expansion. We know there's expansion opportunities. But if I ask for expansion right now with dental and tilt, there is

[0:27:19] Parker Alexander: no way Yeah. There's is going to go. Shoot you down and be like, no. We're gonna

[0:27:22] Jasmin Beckwith: Yeah. And if anything, it's going to sour the relationship.

[0:27:24] Skylar Sanford: Correct. Yeah.

[0:27:25] Jasmin Beckwith: And so there's a big part of that, which I don't know if

[0:27:27] Skylar Sanford: we can You had talk that's speaking of the human element right there.

[0:27:30] Jasmin Beckwith: It's timing.

[0:27:31] Skylar Sanford: Like, you gotta have game sense. You know? It

[0:27:35] Jasmin Beckwith: is. It's a lot of

[0:27:37] Skylar Sanford: So IQ. EQ. EQ. A 100%. AIQ.

[0:27:41] Skylar Sanford: That'll be in the next twelve months, there's gonna be a tool that's gonna that's gonna sell themselves on that. Don't AI with EQ.

[0:27:49] Parker Alexander: Because I'm gonna make it. Okay. This is I don't know.

[0:27:52] Skylar Sanford: Really great.

[0:27:53] Jasmin Beckwith: Okay. Yeah. We're available if you wanna come back.
