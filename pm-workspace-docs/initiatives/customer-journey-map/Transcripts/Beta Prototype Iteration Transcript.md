[0:00:00] Unknown Speaker 1: To us. Do you have do you have do you have whisper flow? Oh, yep. Turn on whisper flow. Alright.

[0:00:06] Unknown Speaker 1: That's embarrassing you're not using. Alright. So I think the the You didn't ask if I have. You know? I don't know.

[0:00:16] Unknown Speaker 2: The thing that

[0:00:17] Unknown Speaker 1: Brian said I think is important is that the work level permissions, work level features versus that. Just wanted

[0:00:27] Unknown Speaker 2: to make that recorded. So, like, if you're a manager or an owner, then you'll see the work level ones. I think the auto enrolling into work level ones, like,

[0:00:36] Unknown Speaker 1: does scare me a little bit. Yeah. I think we can change that. Because you really should know, like, if you're doing something that it does that. But I'm assuming signals is a work level feature.

[0:00:49] Unknown Speaker 1: Right? I think Palmer did. I think so. I think so. Yeah.

[0:00:54] Unknown Speaker 1: But most work level features only managers and owners see, but it that does change some of the behavior. What kind

[0:01:02] Unknown Speaker 2: of features are workspace level? Workspace.

[0:01:04] Unknown Speaker 1: Thank you. Because I Signals. We but it's only signals because that's how we define it on the feature flag is that we're at like, I think we can Yeah. I'm having training session with an example. But has to be on work to this level.

[0:01:18] Unknown Speaker 1: Certain integrations that go into workflows. Like, privacy But then they even agent even A privacy to reach a merchant that has workflow and personal workspace.

[0:01:30] Unknown Speaker 2: How do I keep I still think

[0:01:31] Unknown Speaker 1: that they're only personal because even, like, the workflow agent, the privacy determination agent, it only runs on the person who's running the call. I don't know. I just need to look into it more. That's a good point.

[0:01:44] Unknown Speaker 2: The But what agency agent on the workspace settings, if it's turned on,

[0:01:48] Unknown Speaker 1: it runs on all users. We should. K. So And we should be flexible too so we can have that in the future.

[0:01:57] Unknown Speaker 2: And then what I

[0:02:02] Unknown Speaker 1: so this auto enroll, I don't know if we

[0:02:05] Unknown Speaker 2: should put that on experimental because I also I want feedback when people go enrolled so that gives better us product feedback.

[0:02:12] Unknown Speaker 1: Yeah. I don't yeah. I don't understand. So I would I

[0:02:14] Unknown Speaker 2: would remove from experimental to auto enroll. Some of

[0:02:16] Unknown Speaker 1: that stuff's gonna be total whack. Yeah. Like, how experimental, like, are those things gonna be? Really? Like, Knox had decided to experiment with something without talking to anyone at all because he wanted to start an initiative.

[0:02:27] Unknown Speaker 1: Yeah. So and it's really cool. Yeah. It probably I

[0:02:31] Unknown Speaker 2: so we shouldn't have auto enroll. Yeah. Experimental should not have auto enroll. Beta, I think it does. I'm okay calling it beta, and then the other one is, like, this is

[0:02:40] Unknown Speaker 1: the closed beta, and then there's the do we need

[0:02:42] Unknown Speaker 2: to call

[0:02:43] Unknown Speaker 1: it closed beta? Call an alpha? Or No. Feels beta if you can roll if you can roll yourself. What were you saying about them just combining into one?

[0:02:51] Unknown Speaker 2: So because, like, the other one is, like, the public beta is where we force everyone to be in it.

[0:02:56] Unknown Speaker 1: Yeah. We you don't wanna roll into it. Oh, I actually I like what

[0:03:00] Unknown Speaker 2: So okay. Yeah. I see. That's the that's the difference.

[0:03:03] Unknown Speaker 1: Posthog has they have a beta tag, but they also have Using your Where is it? What a new tag. Example of So instead of it being beta Experimental. Like, for

[0:03:13] Unknown Speaker 2: us, it could be beta,

[0:03:14] Unknown Speaker 1: it goes to new. Yeah. I I would like No.

[0:03:17] Unknown Speaker 2: No. But, like, there's there's still is gonna be a hey. Like, the internal the internal search

[0:03:22] Unknown Speaker 1: I see what you're saying. The internal search tool right now should be everyone has access to it and should

[0:03:26] Unknown Speaker 2: just have a beta attack.

[0:03:27] Unknown Speaker 1: And then it would be new, and then it's general availability.

[0:03:30] Unknown Speaker 2: But that doesn't mean need

[0:03:30] Unknown Speaker 1: to show in this interface at all. No. So it's all we're doing is experimental and then close beta. There's no need to

[0:03:37] Unknown Speaker 2: be And that's why, like well, we would maybe we just call it alpha.

[0:03:41] Unknown Speaker 1: But alpha seems No. It seems half baked.

[0:03:44] Unknown Speaker 2: It seems It seems less half baked than what we're trying to do with the closed beta.

[0:03:47] Unknown Speaker 1: I mean, alpha is the term for what we're talking about. But we'll we'll let us use the terms. To teach users the right thing. Does the ICP understand alpha? I, before working

[0:03:58] Unknown Speaker 2: here, didn't know alpha, man. I'm sorry.

[0:04:00] Unknown Speaker 1: Before I know.

[0:04:01] Unknown Speaker 2: You didn't know how to tie

[0:04:02] Unknown Speaker 1: your shoes. But I'll that's not true. I knew it's

[0:04:05] Unknown Speaker 2: I didn't.

[0:04:05] Unknown Speaker 1: But You're, like, it's

[0:04:07] Unknown Speaker 2: you're young. Who's designing that?

[0:04:08] Unknown Speaker 1: Perfect knot. But my point is, like, people that aren't technical probably won't know alphas. K, guys. K.

[0:04:15] Unknown Speaker 2: It sells people that are selling their own software. They know what it is because they're selling their software as Alpha. And SaaS

[0:04:21] Unknown Speaker 1: That makes our ICP.

[0:04:22] Unknown Speaker 2: And SaaS is our ICP.

[0:04:23] Unknown Speaker 1: Okay. So, like,

[0:04:24] Unknown Speaker 2: it it's okay that you don't

[0:04:26] Unknown Speaker 1: know you don't know things because just out of school.

[0:04:29] Unknown Speaker 2: I like

[0:04:29] Unknown Speaker 1: I think we gotta lean into the elephant thing, and instead of alpha and beta because we're worried about how it sounds, we make our own terms. And we have nonsense right there. The matriarch mama is the one, and then we have the patriarch poppy. I think doing anything with

[0:04:42] Unknown Speaker 2: gender would completely get us canceled. So thank you. Let's give that a shot.

[0:04:46] Unknown Speaker 1: It's it's not about gender roles, though. It's about it's about the herd. That's yeah. We just added hierarchy by gender. Majority.

[0:04:55] Unknown Speaker 1: 100% canceled. Well, the nice thing too is that elephants, as males, are kicked out of the herd and have to go out on their own for ten or so years to be able to find what they're doing. So that's the experimental stage. The young buck. Alright.

[0:05:09] Unknown Speaker 1: So hold on. By

[0:05:12] Unknown Speaker 2: the way, using it for this,

[0:05:13] Unknown Speaker 1: the whisper flow for that is now lets you

[0:05:16] Unknown Speaker 2: end it. It puts it there, and then try to change the prototype. That's how. I hope not. No.

[0:05:22] Unknown Speaker 2: No. No.

[0:05:24] Unknown Speaker 1: That's way nicer than you ever wrote to me. That was pretty nice.

[0:05:27] Unknown Speaker 2: That was pretty nice. I said, you know,

[0:05:30] Unknown Speaker 1: I tie shoes,

[0:05:30] Unknown Speaker 2: and I was a little further than I should have said. Like, I was just trying to call him young.

[0:05:35] Unknown Speaker 1: I'm married. You're he's younger than me. I know. Are you? Wait.

[0:05:42] Unknown Speaker 1: 26. What? Yeah. Are you serious? Yeah.

[0:05:45] Unknown Speaker 1: He's older. And

[0:05:47] Unknown Speaker 2: you both are young, and that's okay.

[0:05:48] Unknown Speaker 1: By the way,

[0:05:50] Unknown Speaker 2: is this a fresh pair of eyes?

[0:05:51] Unknown Speaker 1: There's a lot of benefits. So so I'm gonna go back. I'm gonna edit some things. I'm adding gender.

[0:05:58] Unknown Speaker 2: Yeah. Get it down

[0:05:59] Unknown Speaker 1: to two.

[0:06:00] Unknown Speaker 2: I like Two

[0:06:01] Unknown Speaker 1: gender. That's I what?

[0:06:08] Unknown Speaker 2: I would design it. I would do the prototype, but, like, the first one that we'll deploy will probably still be in the side nav. K.

[0:06:16] Unknown Speaker 1: Because, like, before the other Is this But it would still just be in that drop down, so it wouldn't change. It shouldn't change

[0:06:24] Unknown Speaker 2: much of the setting stuff. I haven't seen

[0:06:25] Unknown Speaker 1: That that drop down as it is will just cover it with that top half.

[0:06:29] Unknown Speaker 2: The the nav doesn't matter. Okay. So and then there once, like, once we get a little bit closer, like, that's but I think that's very close. When AI design things, they do add a lot of spacing sometimes. So I would I would in your doc, you should create a design principle doc that the agent uses to make sure that it follows.

[0:06:51] Unknown Speaker 1: Oh, you mean my human I have so many docs, buddy. Alright. I think there is already a beta features tab in that app viewer menu bar Yeah. Yeah. That you can just use that same one.

[0:07:08] Unknown Speaker 1: So it shouldn't doesn't even need to go in settings.

[0:07:10] Unknown Speaker 2: It just Yeah.

[0:07:10] Unknown Speaker 1: It's right there. Oh, yeah. Yeah. It'll be

[0:07:13] Unknown Speaker 2: right here.

[0:07:13] Unknown Speaker 1: Yeah. Except for it should be a page. And it opens a new page, and it's the new

[0:07:17] Unknown Speaker 2: page that you're showing. Yeah. So I think it's very, very close.

[0:07:20] Unknown Speaker 1: Yeah. Do a deep research agent on the post hoc with the what we would need

[0:07:25] Unknown Speaker 2: to build on that. Cool. Because then I actually think this can be almost a 100% vibe good.

[0:07:32] Unknown Speaker 1: This is kinda cool. So And we had a conversation this morning. What if we did a thing? That's a prototype. Then you can also give if you use ClaudeCode, ClaudeCode's very

[0:07:43] Unknown Speaker 2: good at taking images and matching them

[0:07:44] Unknown Speaker 1: for silent. What are the outcomes?

[0:07:49] Unknown Speaker 2: We just need to record it. So he's gonna create a new prototype because it's almost like we have to do the next version of prototyping. Yep. And then we do the technical specs, and then we vibe code it. Ah, here it is.

[0:08:00] Unknown Speaker 1: Here's my design doc about human centric design. Cool. I would add into that

[0:08:05] Unknown Speaker 2: a more of the if you

[0:08:06] Unknown Speaker 1: It so it's also inside Elephant AI, so it's supposed to be using components that we already have, which is like our chat scene. It was close. It's okay. It was close. It can be better.

[0:08:18] Unknown Speaker 1: Icons just scream AI. The little icons If you go to the prototype, this sparkles. Yeah. That's like that's Oh, yeah.

[0:08:27] Unknown Speaker 2: This screams,

[0:08:28] Unknown Speaker 1: like, slop. I would I would just not do icons. Yeah. Just experiment. Look at this one, though.

[0:08:35] Unknown Speaker 1: I had emojis before. There you go. What the best icon is? It's brain circuit. That's Adam's Brain circle circuit is nasty.

[0:08:42] Unknown Speaker 1: It's a horrendous icon. Mate, that

[0:08:44] Unknown Speaker 2: is my

[0:08:45] Unknown Speaker 1: favorite. Do I it's like the brand of electricity. By the way looked at it, you I How many prototypes

[0:08:49] Unknown Speaker 2: did it take you to get to that one that you wanted to show?

[0:08:51] Unknown Speaker 1: Three. I would've shown you the first one, though.

[0:08:53] Unknown Speaker 2: That's like that's really good.

[0:08:55] Unknown Speaker 1: Like, this one, the it was just honestly some weird design stuff, but not not a ton has changed. Like It was like, oh, they're kind of all in the same place. I want three separate ones. Yeah. Like And You can have Also The good news is is you're doing that right in the code base too.

[0:09:10] Unknown Speaker 1: Yeah. You just say, I know the code. It goes straight into a component library that I almost called you Chandler for some reason. That's right. That Chandler name.

[0:09:17] Unknown Speaker 1: Who's Chandler? That's Chandler. I'm sorry. I was a man. Yeah.

[0:09:23] Unknown Speaker 1: I wanna show you that. But, also, a thought here, it'd be kinda cool if we called it something other than experimental, like something more on brand. Do you wanna do lab? What do you think?

[0:09:33] Unknown Speaker 2: Likes labs? Lab. Hates labs.

[0:09:36] Unknown Speaker 1: What if it was no. But, like, what if it was something like kinda like That Tony like lab? Well, they hated it. He was, like, allergic reaction happens. Like like, the the reaction I had in that one meeting that he's like, dude, it's not actually.

[0:09:50] Unknown Speaker 1: But it's just really funny. I I wasn't thinking labs. I was thinking, like Watering hole? Watering hole is actually kind of a good one. There's some other options, but the Savannah secrets.

[0:10:03] Unknown Speaker 1: Not that. Secrets of the Savannah. I think there's maybe watering hole is the right one, actually. But Kilimanjaro's conjecture. That's a good one.

[0:10:13] Unknown Speaker 1: That is kinda fun. What do think of that, Brian? Kilimanjaro's conjecture. Because you're all the

[0:10:24] Unknown Speaker 2: way in Kilimanjaro. Of course.

[0:10:25] Unknown Speaker 1: There's no rail in Kilimanjaro. I mean, to be honest, I don't think overlooked you completely. I I feel like they're just feeling that they're probably falling so behind that they're going to do this. And no. No.

[0:15:52] Unknown Speaker 1: One of them is building and moving two different teams in parallel. They've had two different teams trying to be building at the same time with different Did I let you down? No. No? Okay.

[0:17:10] Unknown Speaker 1: I didn't know if we, like You can tell by the angry look on my face. I didn't say that the way I wanted to. I'm just having distracted because I'm trying to get this AI model to. Are you how do you feel? It's like tomorrow, I'll set a deadline.

[0:17:31] Unknown Speaker 1: I feel good. End of day tomorrow. I do. Duplication. Like, talking with.

[0:18:01] Unknown Speaker 1: If honestly, if somebody got your titles, all documentation, all of like, everything up to launch you need to do, I'd be fine with. Anyway, that's my that's my super quick.
