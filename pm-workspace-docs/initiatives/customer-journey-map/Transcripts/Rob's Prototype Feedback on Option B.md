[0:04:46] Unknown Speaker 1: Phone's just not gonna get anything. Okay. It's like what I want it to be like is, hey. Your champion, Rebecca, went quiet twelve days ago right after she said x y z. It seems like this is going to be a bigger pain point than she realized given, like, we've lost all momentum.

[0:05:05] Unknown Speaker 1: In this type of case, like, I think we need to blah blah blah blah blah. It's like, there's like, this just there's just a lack of context. So I'm like, hey. The champion went quiet. So what does that mean?

[0:05:20] Unknown Speaker 1: What, like, what are the actual implications of that?

[0:05:22] Unknown Speaker 2: And then what do I do about it?

[0:05:24] Unknown Speaker 3: And then

[0:05:24] Unknown Speaker 1: what I do tied to that specific thing?

[0:05:26] Unknown Speaker 3: Remind me after this. I I think you have a prototype or a you have a design for something he's talking about. Like so if I what if I hover over this and it shows that context? Like, this is still really like, it's I'm trying to make it simple, clean of, like, Champion went quiet, hover over it, and it has, like, a text box show up. And it's like, this is the conversation it was tied to.

[0:05:48] Unknown Speaker 3: This is the contact, and it's like global chat with all of that in context.

[0:05:51] Unknown Speaker 1: I'd almost want it to just, like, automatically for the first one, give me all of that so I don't have to hover, and then I could click to the next one, and then it would, like, transition and give me all the context there.

[0:06:01] Unknown Speaker 3: Is it too much information on a page at once?

[0:06:03] Unknown Speaker 1: I don't know. K. How do

[0:06:05] Unknown Speaker 2: you see yourself going through like, are you living within the the mindset of a single deal at a time, or are you kinda quickly rapid firing through different deals? Maybe that's a different rep versus leader.

[0:06:16] Unknown Speaker 1: I'm gonna do my rep mindset right now.

[0:06:18] Unknown Speaker 2: Yeah.

[0:06:19] Unknown Speaker 1: So I just had a call with Osano today. There's a very high chance we close it end of quarter. There's a okay chance that I can close it this month. After that call, I don't have, like, a back to back, like, I am fully ingrained in, like, that deal. My mindset is completely that deal.

[0:06:41] Unknown Speaker 1: And I want to capitalize on the momentum of both that deal and my mindset of just my mind space is there. Like, everything I need to know, do, see, understand, feel should be within that context. Okay. This is actually something that I talked to James about because I wanted his opinion. So if you guys have a couple minutes, I can walk you through some realization I had here.

[0:07:06] Unknown Speaker 2: This can kinda rip we can take our 02:00 meeting off. This is basically it.

[0:07:10] Unknown Speaker 3: K. Do you guys wanna grab a room, or do wanna I'm

[0:07:16] Unknown Speaker 2: I'm chilling. Just sit here. It's up to you.

[0:07:18] Unknown Speaker 1: I'm fine. Okay. Unless you want a whiteboard or you, like, fidgeting to whiteboard? Some people you, like, can't talk if he doesn't have a whiteboard?

[0:07:25] Unknown Speaker 3: I can try a

[0:07:25] Unknown Speaker 2: whiteboard over here too also.

[0:07:28] Unknown Speaker 1: Okay. So this is literally Osano. I'll bring it back to this because this is what I was talking to

[0:07:33] Unknown Speaker 3: him about.

[0:07:34] Unknown Speaker 1: I actually gave him the world one, world two, world three pitch. He loved it. So I'm like, dang.

[0:07:40] Unknown Speaker 3: Maybe that

[0:07:40] Unknown Speaker 1: just needs to be our pitch that we give people to

[0:07:43] Unknown Speaker 2: I'm gonna steal that. What might we need to do?

[0:07:44] Unknown Speaker 1: Open their eyes. It just gives them the this frame of mind of, like, this is how you should be thinking about AskElephant and the bet we're making on. And if you buy into that, then we can actually get into how we solve your problems. So they did a really good job. We basically identify, like, his number one priority is they if if they have a deal that is a single product that they're selling, their close rate is 45%, which is really freaking good.

[0:08:07] Unknown Speaker 1: Wow. Very good. If they have a if they have a multi

[0:08:15] Unknown Speaker 2: What's the so I'll summary of what do they what do they do? What is Osana Osana?

[0:08:19] Unknown Speaker 1: Osana. They like to security k. Software. K. Something like that.

[0:08:24] Unknown Speaker 3: So, like, you do one pen test? Like I don't

[0:08:26] Unknown Speaker 1: even know the

[0:08:27] Unknown Speaker 3: their product.

[0:08:27] Unknown Speaker 1: I have to look into it. Honestly, I should know more about their business. But if they have a if they're selling a multiproduct deal, that drops to 20% Okay. Which is bad. Close rate?

[0:08:40] Unknown Speaker 1: Yeah. What's our So they go from, like, world class to, like, like, terrible. Okay. Now there's a lot of things that I wish AskElephant would do to help understand why that's happening. That's a different thing.

[0:08:53] Unknown Speaker 1: Yeah. But it really got me thinking within the context of the journey map. I showed you guys those, like, six things in Figma of, like, this is, like, what we know a customer needs to feel, understand, do to, like, get through the the journey. But the actual path that they need to take and the actions a sales rep needs to take is going to be extremely different just depending on the scenario. What personas are you talking to?

[0:09:17] Unknown Speaker 1: Because everyone's selling to probably a few different personas. What's, like, their own specific buying process? What products are we selling, what products, like, together are we selling. Like, all of these things are actually gonna make the sales process different. And so I envision this world where, like, we can be storing all of this data.

[0:09:37] Unknown Speaker 1: I promise it's coming back to this. No.

[0:09:39] Unknown Speaker 3: No. No. I don't I

[0:09:39] Unknown Speaker 1: I'm storing all of this data to say, here's all the information we know about our personas and how we win, their pain points, and all of this. Here's all the information on our products, what pain points these products sell, what features, blah blah blah. So then when AskElephant is crafting the journey, it's actually like a custom journey within the framework. Right? It's not just completely custom.

[0:09:59] Unknown Speaker 1: There's still this framework of discover or pain, value, stakeholder alignment, but there's gonna be so much so many variations that I want to see based off our data, what is the best path to to get this customer through? Because we know if there's if they're buying these things and they are coming from Gong, we know what wins in that category or at least should in an ideal world. So, like, what I wanna see here is show me The path. The path to that. So I I think now that I'm talking about it, I want to see what I need to do now, but I want context of, like, what is coming and what, like, needs to be done for this customer throughout.

[0:10:38] Unknown Speaker 1: I want the context. I want to see and understand, hey, this deal is this type of deal. You're selling multiple products. It's about it's like with Gong. Right now, I am seeing that to close this deal, we need to be doing these next five things over the next month.

[0:10:54] Unknown Speaker 1: The first thing to do right now is this. Let's really dive into, like, this thing. But do you feel like and I don't again, I don't know how it feels how that looks, but you get you feel like how that's a conversation? Yep. It's you consulting me.

[0:11:05] Unknown Speaker 1: It's you walking me through this whole thing versus this is kind of the old paradigm we're coming from is, like, if you go to Gainsight, which is a customer success platform. It's like, oh, I get a red alert. Customer hasn't logged in for thirty days. Go engage. And this is either very static.

[0:11:22] Unknown Speaker 1: You get, like, one piece of information. There's very little context. So that's my I'm I'm verbally processing a little bit with you guys. But, hopefully, that gives you that idea of a light bulb moment I had of, gosh, if we set this up for Asano, it's gonna look very different because they have multiple products, multiple personas, and multiple combinations within that. And I need to know for this deal what is gonna be the best way to do that based off of data.

[0:11:46] Unknown Speaker 1: So and a lot of that data could come. James and I were talking, obviously, if we could analyze their past calls, we could go fill in a lot of that for them. So the onboarding is actually really, really cool. We scraped your website. We looked at your last calls.

[0:11:58] Unknown Speaker 1: Here's what it looks like your products are, what they do. Here's what looks like the kind of personas you like, and now that's all data that the AI is pulling from to customize each one of these journeys. Okay. I'll stop there. No.

[0:12:08] Unknown Speaker 1: Thoughts, question? This yeah. The

[0:12:09] Unknown Speaker 3: whole purpose of the prototype, and I was trying to tell Skyler this is like, I actually don't intend I don't want any of this to stay. I just wanna drive a conversation. Yeah. And some of it is is like, I don't know how to verbalize what I do or don't understand until I have something to show you. And, like Yep.

[0:12:25] Unknown Speaker 3: Like, this is what

[0:12:26] Unknown Speaker 1: it feels like. That's why I'm stoked that we have this this quickly. So So hopefully that helped you see what I like and don't like.

[0:12:31] Unknown Speaker 3: So my my my thought process then is, like, you always talk about storytelling and, like, this this conversation piece. And there's an idea that, like, a timeline tells a story, and that that you have a conversation at a glance. Right? Mhmm.

[0:12:47] Unknown Speaker 1: But

[0:12:48] Unknown Speaker 3: that also is a conversation starter where it gives you a couple of questions that you wanna start. So my thought process is even pulling this up, no response, champion with quiet, good feedback.

[0:13:00] Unknown Speaker 1: Instead of it like, it can have this context where it

[0:13:02] Unknown Speaker 3: also says, do you want to dive deeper into this area? Like, Slack this morning had I don't know if you guys got on to Slack, and it was like, hey. Check out your it had a bunch of suggestions. Did you guys see that? Sometimes.

[0:13:19] Unknown Speaker 3: Someone was like, what type of animal am I based on my Slack history? And so there's, like, seven or eight different questions. Yeah. And I'm a beaver, which I thought was funny. I I'll go find Why does that actually

[0:13:31] Unknown Speaker 2: the tracks, dude? That's incredible.

[0:13:33] Unknown Speaker 1: I don't even know why.

[0:13:36] Unknown Speaker 3: Oh, I don't know where it went. Anyway History? Maybe. Yeah.

[0:13:43] Unknown Speaker 1: It had just a bunch

[0:13:44] Unknown Speaker 3: of list of questions and your builder collaborative detail oriented, the touch of personality to Colin. Yeah. Anyway, I thought that was funny, but but what I'm getting at is actually that I would have never chatted with the Slack bot, but it asked me a couple questions. And one was funny, and I was in a good mood. And I was like, oh, I'll click on that.

[0:14:02] Unknown Speaker 3: But some are really good of, like, what projects have you not talked about recently? Mhmm. So the my thought process is the blank I I think I'm trying to get away from my thought of, uh, this, of, like, it's conversational. Like, just this empty box

[0:14:19] Unknown Speaker 1: of No. No. Slate.

[0:14:20] Unknown Speaker 3: So that's where I'm trying to make sure I understand. Go back

[0:14:22] Unknown Speaker 1: to your prototype. I think what actually, I I know I know I'm a big, like, tell stories type of guy, but I just think stories resonate with humans, and it's how we've been for thousands and thousands of years. If I click into here, I want I want a hierarchy of information that, like, actually tells a story how I need to. So rather than just seeing, like, this static, like, at risk, here's like, this is actually almost where I feel like maybe it's like a timeline or more text heavy of, like, give me a snapshot of, like, here's where we should here's where we are based off, again, this customer, not some static pipeline. These are the steps that I'm seeing that we probably need to take.

[0:14:59] Unknown Speaker 1: You can override them at any point. And then down here, I do wanna see, like, hey. I have your recommended actions below, so then I can scroll down and see recommended actions because that would naturally follow. Here's here's where we're at high level. Here's everything going on.

[0:15:13] Unknown Speaker 1: I'm talking to you. Maybe it's two or three sentences, not too much text, but it's that's the conversation part is, like, it should still feel like AI like, AskElephant's my partner in this. Hey. Below are the next actions based off of this. If you want to chat with me to maybe readjust for this customer, again, conversation, then maybe I do wanna, like, with it, readjust what that looks like.

[0:15:36] Unknown Speaker 1: But then the hierarchy is, like, give me the overarching, like, what's going on, then tell me the actions and help me do it. And then if I want to like, I I don't even know if I put this in here right now, but that hierarchy of, like, help me take my brain and think through it the right way is what I'm looking for. And to me, some kind of timeline, big picture, tech, like, verbalizing what needs to happen and then letting me work with it would be awesome. How

[0:16:04] Unknown Speaker 3: how much do you care about so how much are you context switching between deals?

[0:16:11] Unknown Speaker 1: Okay. I'm a sales rep. A lot. Sales rep a lot. K.

[0:16:15] Unknown Speaker 1: So because in an ideal world, like, I was like, oh, I got Fosano. I was, like, fully thought about it. Well, in another world, you have eight calls that day, and you don't have the luxury of Yeah. Might not get to AskElephant before you have four calls.

[0:16:27] Unknown Speaker 3: So you almost wanna be able to you wanna be able to view a company, a deal, and understand where like, what has the journey been? Like, remind me. Like, refresh me on what's the journey been and where

[0:16:39] Unknown Speaker 1: are we trying to go?

[0:16:41] Unknown Speaker 3: Well, and I as as possible.

[0:16:42] Unknown Speaker 1: Yes. And I would want to still see. How can you know? And, again, maybe it's not what I showed you, but I think that's a starting point. I'd love to see visualize.

[0:16:49] Unknown Speaker 1: Like, here are the six things that need to be true for the journey. Like, I don't see and I don't know what these two things are. That's the easy ad. It's not good. See, because this this is not the journey.

[0:16:58] Unknown Speaker 3: This is this is process. Right? Yep. And I

[0:17:00] Unknown Speaker 1: know again, I know you didn't actually

[0:17:01] Unknown Speaker 3: do this.

[0:17:01] Unknown Speaker 1: This is AI.

[0:17:02] Unknown Speaker 3: But, no, it's important to say.

[0:17:03] Unknown Speaker 1: But I almost envision, like and maybe more than horizontal, it's, like, vertical. It's, like, here's the health of each one of those things that the customer needs to, like, do. Massive red flag. You have zero stakeholders that actually have decision. Like, that is, like, real context of, like, oh, this is why this deal is failing.

[0:17:24] Unknown Speaker 1: So I think that needs to be part of the journey is what did we define that's when I say customers journey. It's like what do we define needs to happen for the journey to be successful? Okay. I need to know where that's breaking down or where we're actually crushing that. And that's the part I need more context.

[0:17:39] Unknown Speaker 1: It's like you're crushing this because we know and again, we're not gonna have all the data upfront, but we know when we go up against Gong, if they can understand this pain point and this value prop compared to Gong, we actually crush it because Gong sucks here. So the fact that you haven't gotten them to articulate something along those lines, we're I'm way less confident you're gonna sell this because we know that's what works against Gong. That's the conversation. That's the specific drain to this customer. And I know it's gonna be a process, and Brian's probably hating hearing all that because we need a ton of data to do that.

[0:18:14] Unknown Speaker 1: But there's still something we could start with there.

[0:18:19] Unknown Speaker 2: Brian doesn't object about scope. We have early discussions. Don't

[0:18:24] Unknown Speaker 3: This is your this is your journey? All of also, Skyler, for for you, like, we had this conversation yesterday. You sent me all the stuff.

[0:18:36] Unknown Speaker 2: I sent you a stuff.

[0:18:38] Unknown Speaker 3: The the Notion doc. Conversation with people. So I made this prototype again with the intention of, like, furthering the conversation. Mhmm. I wanna make sure that we're, like, having productive conversations about backdooring.

[0:18:49] Unknown Speaker 3: Does this cramp on your design style?

[0:18:52] Unknown Speaker 2: I I I'm not I'm not well, stuff Not style.

[0:18:55] Unknown Speaker 1: You know do you know what

[0:18:56] Unknown Speaker 3: I'm trying to say?

[0:18:56] Unknown Speaker 1: This isn't even as good as

[0:18:58] Unknown Speaker 3: Well, because the intention is not, hey, I I wanna get to a state where

[0:19:02] Unknown Speaker 2: Style, no. But I actually have no strong opinions on what this layout should be and like this actually helps me Okay. Like see possible

[0:19:11] Unknown Speaker 3: That's what I'm trying to

[0:19:11] Unknown Speaker 2: drive. I I mean if you want more of a meta comment here is like, I think that what I will be driving is there's so much possible noise. And this is, like, the even the best one I've seen. That's, like, like, feels like the most, uh, more condensed and not, like, obnoxious.

[0:19:29] Unknown Speaker 3: It's a lot

[0:19:30] Unknown Speaker 1: of noise.

[0:19:30] Unknown Speaker 2: This one. Yeah. Um, like, I actually am gonna push for, like, very, very focused views Mhmm. Rather than everything all at once. So it's like, let's give you the high notes.

[0:19:43] Unknown Speaker 2: And if you wanna see the context and covers, then you can just, like, easy drill in. Don't have to necessarily, like, go into a full new page, but, like To

[0:19:51] Unknown Speaker 1: that point, though, the more I think about it, I I really would love to go to a full new page to work on this too. James has brought the idea of a workspace as well, but, like, as so if if we clicked on this let's just say we had the high level. Here's where we are.

[0:20:05] Unknown Speaker 3: Like, the view full account details takes a new page?

[0:20:08] Unknown Speaker 1: Or Yeah. But I I like up here, it'd be like part of this would be like, do you wanna work on this deal together? Talk to me about Take me to, like, that that would be more of the chat experience.

[0:20:19] Unknown Speaker 3: Yeah.

[0:20:19] Unknown Speaker 1: Where I'm like, this is gonna help me look at things. And if I wanna execute execute these things really quickly, but if I wanna go, like, spend five minutes, like, let me work with you on this deal. Yeah. Now that's chat. Now I envision your chat on the left.

[0:20:32] Unknown Speaker 1: There's artifacts on the right. Like, hey. When you send this email. What do you think, like I think of Claudia. I can actually, like, now work on that deal versus trying to fit everything to work on the deal here.

[0:20:43] Unknown Speaker 1: This should just give me enough information to know either do an action, do this, or I see enough that I need to go into this deal.

[0:20:50] Unknown Speaker 3: I wanna add to that and get to your question too is that I I truly wanna do as much work as possible inside AskElephant, but there's some things that limit that work, especially for product design engineering. One of those is that, like, nothing is permanent. Like, chats can exist, but I can't really go back

[0:21:08] Unknown Speaker 1: to it. I can't Yeah.

[0:21:09] Unknown Speaker 3: I can't work somewhere and then have it save an artifact or document anything and then move away from it. So, like, in in Cursor, I have this customer journey map where I literally just copy and pasted the transcripts that we

[0:21:19] Unknown Speaker 2: had Yeah.

[0:21:20] Unknown Speaker 3: From and I know that's what we're trying to get away from, but I put those in there and then have conversations, and one might drive my research that I'm doing, and one might drive a revenue document, and one might drive a So now I feel confident to step away, never have to look at those chats again, and say, okay. I've got something tangible Yeah. That I can come back to this project, that I can come back to this deal, to this company to say, not only do I have the context for the company, but, maybe for Osano, one question you you mentioned is, I don't actually know much about the company. I don't know what their product is. And so he's gonna go back and say, hey.

[0:21:53] Unknown Speaker 3: Do research and tell me more about the company and add that to their context. And so now there's a document, and it's Osano's product road map, like what they're looking to build, how we might be able to integrate with them. Am I are we on the same page? Like, sorry. That that's a very product focused, but, like, the research that you do is saved in that workspace, but then it is, I'm gonna go work on the deal.

[0:22:13] Unknown Speaker 3: Correct. What are next steps? How I wanna make a pitch deck. I want to Yeah.

[0:22:16] Unknown Speaker 1: And I'd I want so there's this element of tell me, like, visual visual hierarchy and text. Help me understand what's going on at a high level. Then there's, like, what needs to be done at a high level. And I should be able to see those and execute those very quickly because there might be deals where I'm like, I know this one's super solid. I just need to, like, go do some stuff.

[0:22:36] Unknown Speaker 1: And there's gonna be a lot of times where I want to work with AI to actually move this deal forward, and that's that concept of, like it's basically, like, imagine Ruben saying, Kennard, I have all like, I have this deal. I wanna go work with you on it and, like, figure out how we, like, go get it to the next, like, next place it needs to get. What do Can you hop in a room for ten minutes with me? And, like, let's, like, work through this deal together. Can AskElephant just provide that space to go work with AI where it has all the context, it has everything that's being saved to it, but then it's that conversation of, like, hey.

[0:23:12] Unknown Speaker 1: I think, like, this is the next step, I come in, they said this though, and I think it actually might be better to prioritize in AI. I was like, that's a great point, but remember, they're coming from this type of competitor. So they're probably used to x y z. That's oh, that's a good like, now I can work with it.

[0:23:27] Unknown Speaker 3: So we we had a the conversation right before break, right after break was James meets with partners every he meets with the partnership team every week, one on one, plans out what deals do you have in the pipeline, how likely are they to close, what you're talking about. So as a rep, it's I'm replacing you get it. I'm replacing James. I'm gonna go through that. For each deal, I can work on it.

[0:23:46] Unknown Speaker 3: Now that's the rep view, and I feel like I have a really clear understanding of that. To take it just one level higher to James, to you Mhmm. I imagine this being, like, your account and then maybe another hierarchy of, like, Ruben's deals, Pete's deals, and seeing trends across those deals, how much is in the pipeline, likelihood across that. And so now you can still do work inside of those deals, but you can do work on Pete and his pipeline. So specifically, like, what are what are the trends we're seeing in Pete's pipeline?

[0:24:18] Unknown Speaker 3: What are like, are those clients actually gonna close? And then are these clients that Pete has a good chance of closing? Like, is are his efforts worth it? Is that

[0:24:28] Unknown Speaker 1: Yeah. I wanna rephrase it, though. Please. Remember what like, the actual outcomes we want to drive, I think, will be very important.

[0:24:37] Unknown Speaker 3: It's like I know where my customers are at in their journey.

[0:24:39] Unknown Speaker 1: Not the outcome we want. Sorry.

[0:24:42] Unknown Speaker 2: No. Just meeting with a customer in five minutes.

[0:24:45] Unknown Speaker 1: Oh, Kylie.

[0:24:45] Unknown Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. I'm not don't know how far. I'm just kinda level set just under, like, just some discovery, like, where they're at, what she's trying to do. But how can I

[0:24:52] Unknown Speaker 1: what's gonna be the easiest way for me, like, show her

[0:24:54] Unknown Speaker 3: this prototype? Send you a link, and then you can send it to her.

[0:24:58] Unknown Speaker 2: Sweet. I'm gonna go

[0:24:59] Unknown Speaker 1: prep for that call right now.

[0:25:00] Unknown Speaker 3: K. Let me make sure

[0:25:01] Unknown Speaker 2: I have that. I will obviously share

[0:25:05] Unknown Speaker 3: the knowledge. K. Will you restate that? And then I'll we'll stop the conversation because I wanna leave

[0:25:10] Unknown Speaker 2: with link in the next couple of minutes.

[0:25:12] Unknown Speaker 1: Yeah. Let me try to

[0:25:13] Unknown Speaker 3: get that pulled up.

[0:25:25] Unknown Speaker 1: When we talk, how

[0:25:28] Unknown Speaker 3: how far off are me and Skyler?

[0:25:33] Unknown Speaker 1: I don't know because this is why I'm glad you put a prototype because everything always sounds good conceptually, but until we put it together And

[0:25:39] Unknown Speaker 3: I I actually think this is pretty far from what I envision it being. But it's a starting point.

[0:25:43] Unknown Speaker 2: Yeah. But it's a

[0:25:44] Unknown Speaker 3: starting point.

[0:25:49] Unknown Speaker 1: Sorry. Will you Yeah. I was just letting you send this. Thank you so much. Do you feel like you and Skyler are pretty off?

[0:26:35] Unknown Speaker 3: No. No. I don't. But I just I wanna ask the question so that if you meant 20%, you guys aren't getting it. Like, we keep on looping.

[0:26:42] Unknown Speaker 3: I know we talk about the same thing multiple times, but it never feels redundant.

[0:26:46] Unknown Speaker 1: No. Because I don't know what it's supposed to exactly look like or feel like either. Yeah.

[0:26:50] Unknown Speaker 3: But Talk about James.

[0:26:52] Unknown Speaker 1: And I I don't even know no. Outcomes. I don't even know what like, maybe we even, like, title things like this. Because what we don't wanna do is just go to the old way of thinking of, like, what people wanna know is, like, the trends across their reps. False.

[0:27:08] Unknown Speaker 1: It's not what they wanna know. A manager wants to know what can I do today that can drive revenue forward for my team? What can I do tomorrow? What can I do over this month, this quarter to actually drive revenue? Now one of those things is I wanna be able to coach my team to be better, so I need to know the trends and know, like, where to coach them.

[0:27:29] Unknown Speaker 1: But that's not the end all be all. Yeah. It's like AskElephant should be helping people reframe to say, I don't want I don't want them to just know where all my team's deals are. I wanna know what are the things I could do today to help my team move their deal forward. And then I wanna know what could I do this week to help my team better hit their number.

[0:27:47] Unknown Speaker 3: What do you do as a sales leader to remove yourself from from, like well, I I have an assumption that sales leaders can fall into a couple of different categories and, like, there's a spectrum of the savior complex and completely hands off. And the savior complex in my mind is I've always been the best sales rep where I work. I am the best sales rep. I can close any deal. So they feel like if anything ever goes off the rails, they have to be involved or else the deal won't close.

[0:28:21] Unknown Speaker 3: And then there's a little bit revolve like, removed from that. That's the spectrum, and then I'm not ever gonna get involved. So what point do you think, Rob, what you're like, me actually getting on a call with Pete will get the deal across the line, will actually help, or me just coaching Pete. Like, how much of this adds to that? Like, you have to be involved in every single deal, or you can have the peace of mind that the right steps are actually being taken, and there's actually only two things you need to be involved in.

[0:28:50] Unknown Speaker 1: Exactly it. Because a lot of times a lot of times when, like, leaders ask questions, it's not because they don't trust or something. They just don't know. So, like I If you have a good reputation, then in general, like, I don't have to ask you as many questions because I'm just gonna trust because I can't. Yeah.

[0:29:09] Unknown Speaker 1: But a lot of times when I ask a question, I'm also like, do need

[0:29:11] Unknown Speaker 3: me? I have a call

[0:29:13] Unknown Speaker 1: at 01:15. I do wanna talk to you. Okay. Think I'll need something released so he can join, but you and I need to align on something. I can join?

[0:29:21] Unknown Speaker 1: I can join. Don't know. Okay. Okay. I I get what you're saying.

[0:29:31] Unknown Speaker 1: So, you know, like, if AskElephant as a manager then could say, hey. This is the customer journey that you guys have outlined. Obviously, it doesn't say this, but it's inherent. And, like so now when I say this deal is really like, even though Pete said he did discovery, he checked that box off. Like, he did the discovery call.

[0:29:49] Unknown Speaker 1: We know this deal is actually at risk because discovery was done in a way that didn't actually get them to articulate their pain well enough, and there like, there's actually no real anchor point to this deal. Like, this is maybe a coin flip at best. K. Yeah. I've already alerted Pete, but it might be worth, like, going back and helping him rethink how to go.

[0:30:08] Unknown Speaker 1: We don't think go on

[0:30:09] Unknown Speaker 2: the K.

[0:30:10] Unknown Speaker 1: Like, you know what I mean? Like, so now I'm like, and now a different deal, I could see this is healthy because x y z. And I can always look at it and be like, AI is being a little generous. I don't think it's actually that healthy. But the more we put up that structure of, like, you're you're defining what healthy means, so, like, you should be pretty confident when AI says it.

[0:30:27] Unknown Speaker 1: K. That's the visibility that nobody has right now even with AskElephant. And so, like, we're trying our best to find the information and then decide, can I go help?

[0:30:35] Unknown Speaker 3: K. Last question I have. Yesterday, as we were talking, I kept on like, I I have this idea in my head, and I'm having a hard time verbalizing some of the vocal process and try to get through it quick. Is that if we really wanna change, like, the perception, the paradigm, the the actual way that revenue teams get work done. Mhmm.

[0:30:56] Unknown Speaker 3: Right? That that's kind of what we're driving is moving it. Because part of it has to be, like, a change in language of how

[0:31:02] Unknown Speaker 1: you talk about things. And a big piece of that is That's that's my belief.

[0:31:05] Unknown Speaker 2: I don't

[0:31:06] Unknown Speaker 1: know if anyone else I actually believe that pretty strongly.

[0:31:08] Unknown Speaker 3: Very clear in the way that you talk about it and in a in the best way. Like, I you never said that yesterday, but in the meeting, all I could think of was we can't have it on the page say, Pete didn't do discovery. It has to very clearly state, Osano hasn't seen the value of the product or vocalized their own pain point.

[0:31:28] Unknown Speaker 1: Yeah. Maybe they have seen it, but they haven't vocalized. There's no evidence.

[0:31:31] Unknown Speaker 3: It's there's an assumption that that the sales rep is making that this has happened. There's no proof there. Mhmm. Do we need to verify? Like, how sure are we?

[0:31:39] Unknown Speaker 3: So I don't know how actionable this is, but part of this is, like, I wanna make sure that the language of what we're what we're presenting, but also saying is there too. Because, like, looking at this good demo feedback, Champion went quiet. That's close, but it's, like, part of that journey is for the sales process is the the rep and the stakeholder have to have constant communication within a certain bound lines so that, like, we can understand whatever

[0:32:11] Unknown Speaker 1: it is.

[0:32:11] Unknown Speaker 3: Yeah. So this should really be, like, the champion fell out of the communication cycle that's required for

[0:32:17] Unknown Speaker 1: them to reach the end goal. Correct. This is and maybe this is how I articulate it. Hopefully, it wouldn't do this if it had this context, but the champion going quiet as isn't this is it. It's not inherently a bad thing.

[0:32:29] Unknown Speaker 1: If you told me do have a call?

[0:32:32] Unknown Speaker 3: No. I just forgot to send this

[0:32:33] Unknown Speaker 1: to sorry. I just really quickly need to send it to Sky It is loading. I just gave the wrong thing. I'll leave you with this, and I'll go find

[0:32:52] Unknown Speaker 3: one. Yeah.

[0:32:52] Unknown Speaker 1: But it

[0:33:02] Unknown Speaker 3: should already be set up in this workspace, so just, uh, post it to this build project link.

[0:33:08] Unknown Speaker 1: Okay. Good? Yeah. So go back. This is one of reasons I hated CSPs.

[0:33:18] Unknown Speaker 1: Now, again, I hope because this is AI backed, it wouldn't do this because it'd be smart enough to know, but it still doesn't it doesn't transfer confidence to me. What happens if two weeks ago, they said, hey. I'm gonna be out of town. We'll reconvene at the start of the year. And I haven't talked to them in twelve days.

[0:33:40] Unknown Speaker 1: Is that a an issue? Most likely not. Again, hopefully, because of the transcript, you'd know. But just saying that the champion won client doesn't actually mean anything. It's Yeah.

[0:33:51] Unknown Speaker 1: Within this journey for this customer that we have constructed because a, you have a framework, and b, we took all of this data and made kind of a custom ish journey. What's not happening across what we know is important. The champion going quiet actually is irrelevant.

[0:34:07] Unknown Speaker 2: K.

[0:34:07] Unknown Speaker 1: The champion going quiet when they said they're gonna get back to me tomorrow on something, and I followed up with them five times, and we have no other follow ups, not a major concern.

[0:34:17] Unknown Speaker 2: Okay. But it's

[0:34:18] Unknown Speaker 1: not because they went quiet. And that's where I was saying maybe a solutioning with the chat. It's like it's the context. It's the reasoning. It's the working together to say, I know the whole picture.

[0:34:28] Unknown Speaker 1: I'm not just giving you some stupid alert that you're used to with every other platform. I'm working on this together, and I'm intelligent about it. So

[0:34:37] Unknown Speaker 3: last thing because I know what you mean.

[0:34:39] Unknown Speaker 1: I know.

[0:34:45] Unknown Speaker 3: Suggested actions, and it is more like open conversation. Like, at never mind. Let let's move on. I'm I'm gonna erase that. Close that book.

[0:34:54] Unknown Speaker 1: But, also, if wanna go to AskElephant, if you just wanna talk to it, go to search. And it should be oh gosh. This is so slow. I've been working on it. Kane's been doing a ton of Has he?

[0:35:09] Unknown Speaker 1: Okay. There should be one by me that is just a little bit ago. Anyway, there's a brain dump that James and I yeah. Being triplicated. Yeah.

[0:35:24] Unknown Speaker 1: Why do we a bunch of duplicates? I will log a ticket for that.

[0:35:29] Unknown Speaker 3: But

[0:35:30] Unknown Speaker 1: Anyway, there's James and I, like, at, like, ten or eleven today had a actually, it's, like, 10:30. Did another brain dump on all this if you want more context of some ideas we had. Is that helpful?

[0:35:44] Unknown Speaker 3: Yeah. It's super helpful. I also I'm
