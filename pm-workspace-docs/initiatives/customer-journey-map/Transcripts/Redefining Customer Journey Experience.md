[0:00:22] Unknown Speaker 1: Like, and not be embarrassed about it. Like, why not have it be the same thing? Like yeah. That's act so that's a very good point. So So hold on.

[0:01:44] Unknown Speaker 1: I like where you're going. I wanna see if I can say it back. Oh, I really like that. So the first step to any journey is deciding where to go, where you wanna go. And that and the so you have to work with the customer to make sure that you talk about their goals, their outcomes, the things they want, and then and how does that align with you?

[0:02:10] Unknown Speaker 1: It makes it so you do a better job of doing ICP and not working with people that you've forced into the funnel or forced onto a journey. Like, it's way better for all aspects of human human connection is like, hey. Let's talk about what you really want out of this. And then we like, that you can then show to the customer, like, hey. This is this is kind of the journey that we I'm I'm kind of expecting for us.

[0:02:39] Unknown Speaker 1: I'm gonna be your tour guide through these first four steps, and then I'm gonna introduce you to Rob. And Rob's gonna take you to the promised land.

[0:02:47] Unknown Speaker 2: So

[0:02:53] Unknown Speaker 1: I journey path. For some reason, me thinking, like, you you can't show your you don't wanna show your stages or your funnels to your custom like, to your customer that you're working with because it's selfish.

[0:04:12] Unknown Speaker 2: Yeah.

[0:04:21] Unknown Speaker 1: What what about a customer experience platform versus Journey? I do too. I hate so a revenue experience platform, which is the revenue is the selfish aspect. The experience is the other one aspect. The like, from prospect to customer Mhmm.

[0:04:53] Unknown Speaker 1: Journey experience. Like, the word prospect makes it a sales tool. Customer makes it a their other tool. Yeah. But a prospect to a customer experience tool.

[0:05:22] Unknown Speaker 1: They're they're obviously, we know that there's something there. Like, things are but I that was with the thought that could change my me this morning. Sorry if it took me so long to catch up. The the thing that, like because I you saw how allergic I've always been against pipeline and funnel, and, like, I'm like, I don't want this. But I couldn't have told you why until just barely.

[0:05:50] Unknown Speaker 1: Barely. Like, And I really do think that we should go criticize pipelines, funnels, and, like, yes, we should still show some of the data, but, like, it should always be in the mindset of, like, this is the journey we the tour we wanna take people on, so we need to find the the right people that wanna go on this door, this journey. I can hear you outside if you wanna just walk into my room. I thought you'd be excited about that. I am recording just so I don't lose

[0:06:58] Unknown Speaker 2: all of this. Here's one thing. I the more we can articulate it do you remember last year, there was this event you signed me up for or told me to go to? One of the OG VCs. It was down in the kiln in Provo.

[0:07:13] Unknown Speaker 2: He wrote a book.

[0:07:14] Unknown Speaker 1: I forgot what the guy's called. My name was.

[0:07:17] Unknown Speaker 2: The only one told me to go. I can't go. Go take notes for me. And one of the things that he had said that, like, stuck out to me, probably the only thing I remember, is, like, when you're trying to do something that actually, like, is novel or, like, truly innovative, like, the first thing you have to do is, like, help people understand that there's,

[0:07:41] Unknown Speaker 1: like, a decision to do at a crossroads.

[0:07:43] Unknown Speaker 2: They either, like, agree with you or they don't, and it's just, like, really big bold statement. I don't know if it's it is this, but when you say, like, pipelines are dead or, like, we should go against that, it's like there are certain things of, like, the traditional way of thinking about sales that could be interesting to say Stop throw

[0:08:01] Unknown Speaker 1: forcing your customers through a funnel. Like, I just think that's so, like, so bold.

[0:08:07] Unknown Speaker 2: And you either agree with it or not. Like, now what we're doing is working.

[0:08:10] Unknown Speaker 1: It's Yeah.

[0:08:11] Unknown Speaker 2: It's great. Okay. Cool. Like, you're probably not in mindset anyway for us to talk to you because you're gonna be so stuck in your ways.

[0:08:16] Unknown Speaker 1: But if we literally go criticize funnels and pipelines and we focus on journey, even though I like I still You love the concept.

[0:08:24] Unknown Speaker 2: I love the concept. Word itself is just

[0:08:27] Unknown Speaker 1: I the customer journey makes me feel like it was not a full stack tool.

[0:08:32] Unknown Speaker 2: And I think because the only reason for that is because people don't actually understand

[0:08:36] Unknown Speaker 1: what a customer journey is. Correct.

[0:08:38] Unknown Speaker 2: Because it's literally more comprehensive than even, like, the full it's like before they even interact with you, what are they doing? Like, the whole customer journey should be the most comprehensive way to talk

[0:08:49] Unknown Speaker 1: about it, but people don't think about that because it's customer. Yes. And customers post for sale.

[0:08:56] Unknown Speaker 2: But at its core, the customer journey is actually irrelevant to the teams, and

[0:09:01] Unknown Speaker 1: it's before we even interact with them on the sales side. Yeah. But that does make me want to, as we do this, to be able to say, hey. Don't know what your customer is? Don't know don't have a customer journey?

[0:09:13] Unknown Speaker 1: Work with us. Correct. And then we consult on the customer. Like, we're not consulting on AI automation. No.

[0:09:20] Unknown Speaker 1: We consult on helping them define and play a very clear customer journey.

[0:09:24] Unknown Speaker 2: But that's also and, not but, and that's where I want us to, like, go with the partner network.

[0:09:31] Unknown Speaker 1: Is teach our partners how to create customer journey maps. And why is it beneficial? Why should you have a customer journey? It actually makes it so ICPs are easier because you actually know who your customer should be.

[0:09:43] Unknown Speaker 2: Well, but also, like, Katie's sales methodology and all the stuff he's been doing is within the context of his expertise of those types of journeys that he has built for his sales team to, like, facilitate. So it takes some, like, training for them to, like, get in the right mindset as well. Like, a partner network where we don't have to be the experts in every single type of journey or every, like, niche that has maybe a slight variation. But

[0:10:10] Unknown Speaker 1: there now I have lots of thoughts about how do we show our do I don't know actually the best way to show a journey through our platform. So now it's not about before you were talking about what does it feel like to work with an AI? I now am thinking, what does it feel like to make sure I always know where a customer is at and where they need to go and what their journey is. So we have to make sure I want to change it so that everywhere it has a clear agreed upon goal, or if not, it gives you questions to come up with a goal where it like, that is the first thing. So I have this meeting at 10:00 That's to set to close post on LinkedIn.

[0:10:46] Unknown Speaker 1: Why is there not a clear, like, goal of what this customer is trying to achieve and make sure that we work towards that?
