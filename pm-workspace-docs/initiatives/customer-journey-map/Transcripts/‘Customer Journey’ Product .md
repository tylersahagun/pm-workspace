Project Phase: Definition

# Understanding the Problem

> **For AskElephant:** 
This is moving beyond **note-taking and summaries** into **operational excellence**. The opportunity is to own the *execution layer* of GTM—the place where visibility becomes action, and action drives revenue.
> 

> **For Customers:
Better deals**: Less slippage, higher close rates, faster cycles.
**Better forecasts**: Reps and managers both trust the pipeline.
**Better coaching**: Specific, context-driven guidance instead of generic feedback.
**Better customer outcomes**: Context carries through—handoffs are seamless, expansions are proactive.

## **Primary Outcome**

**Reps and managers can instantly answer: "I know where my customer is in their journey"** with full context, not guesswork.

This requires solving three foundational dependencies:

- **Know who my customers are**
- **Know what the journey stages are**
- **Know where they currently sit in that journey**

# **Opportunities and Critical Gaps to Solve:**

### **1. Forecast Reliability & Deal Health**

- **Outcome**: Managers can trust their pipeline and forecasts because they have visibility into *why* deals are at their current stage, not just the stage itself.
- **Evidence**: Rob's example of the 64-point deal score—AskElephant explains the reasoning, making forecasts defensible to leadership and the board.1
- **Impact**: Stops leadership from being surprised and "lying to the board." Gets accurate signals early for risk mitigation.

### **2. Proactive Coaching & Pipeline Management**

- **Outcome**: Managers like James move from reactive to *proactive*—they know exactly where to intervene and help reps overcome obstacles in real-time.
- **Evidence**: James now closes deals *because* he understands the context and can coach reps on specific gaps (e.g., "you haven't established *why* they're buying").1
- **Impact**: Reps get coached with clarity, not generic feedback. Deals move faster and with higher confidence.

### **3. Action-Driven Execution (Not Just Visibility)**

- **Outcome**: Reps don't spend 8 hours figuring out what to do next—they log in and see 3-5 clear, prioritized actions with context and draft content ready to review/send.
- **Evidence**: James wants workspace notifications like "You haven't sent something you promised. Here's a drafted email. Review or send?"1
- **Impact**: Massive behavior change—reps actually execute follow-ups instead of getting lost in calendar/noise. Higher activity, better conversion.

### **4. Multi-Persona Journey Tracking**

- **Outcome**: Unlike CRM stage-based thinking, AskElephant tracks *each persona's* progress through their own journey, while the company has an overarching journey.
- **Evidence**: RevOps person on one journey, CS person on another—all contributing to overall customer success and renewal likelihood.1
- **Impact**: Prevents false sense of security. Teams spot risks earlier because they see that not *everyone* is progressing, even if the "deal" looks healthy.
</aside>

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/star_yellow.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/star_yellow.svg" width="40px" />

### **5. Better Handoffs (Sales → CS → Service)**

- **Outcome**: Context travels with customers. Nothing is lost between teams because the journey and critical context are preserved and surfaced, not buried in emails.
- **Evidence**: The conversation emphasized that "context continuity drives better outcomes."1
- **Impact**: Onboarding is smoother, expansion/upsell timing is clearer, churn risk is visible earlier.

<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/star_green.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/star_green.svg" width="40px" />

### **1. Visibility Gaps**

**Problem:** Reps are blind to customer context at a glance.

- Can see deal stage in HubSpot, but can't see:
    - What actions can be taken next
    - What happened before (SDR interactions, previous work)
    - What the customer is waiting on
    - Why a deal moved between stages

**Outcome:** Reps should see **stage context + required actions** without leaving the interface or doing manual research.

</aside>

<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/star_green.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/star_green.svg" width="40px" />

### **2. Attribution & Change History Gaps**

**Problem:** Property changes (deal stage, CSM reassignment, seat additions, expansion status) happen without documented reasoning.

**Critical examples:**

- Deal moves from "Closed Lost" → "Closed Won" — *Why?* Unknown.
- CSM reassigned from Aaron to Celine — *Was the customer notified?* Unknown.
- Seats added (5, 12, etc.) — *When? Why? Who requested?* Requires manual digging.

**Outcome:** Every property change should be **tracked with reason, owner, and timestamp**. For CSM transitions especially: *visibility into notification status and relationship continuity*.

**HubSpot cannot track:**

- Property change history
- Reason for changes
- Workflow attribution (which action/person triggered a change?)
- Expansion progression
- Journey-level context

**Outcome:** AskElephant must **fill these gaps** — either via enhanced tracking, custom fields, or API solutions to make HubSpot data journey-aware.

<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/star_green.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/star_green.svg" width="40px" />

### **3. Multi-Deal/Expansion Complexity**

**Problem:** One company with multiple deals (expansion deals) looks like disconnected transactions, not a customer journey.

- No way to visualize the progression from initial deal → expansion → expansion
- Reps can't answer: *"Is this customer ready for expansion?"* without asking AskElephant

**Outcome:** Reps should see **all deals for a company as one journey timeline**, with clear expansion status and progression logic.

</aside>

<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/star_green.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/star_green.svg" width="40px" />

### **4. Onboarding/Ramp-Up Time**

**Problem:** When a rep (Jazz) takes over a book of business after 2 months, they can't quickly prioritize.

- Can't see which clients are most impactful
- Can't see where each customer sits in their journey
- Requires deep AskElephant investigation just to get oriented

**Outcome:** Reps should have a **prioritized customer view** showing journey stage, health status, and next steps — *actionable in minutes, not hours*.

        ### **Core Value Drivers For Sales Leaders**
        
        <aside>
        <img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/star_yellow.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/star_yellow.svg" width="40px" />
        
        **1. Deal Health & Forecasting Clarity**
        
        Benjamin emphasized that sales leaders need real-time visibility into:
        
        - Which deals are actually progressing (vs. stalled)
        - Outstanding items prospects are waiting on
        - Deal health scoring to identify where to focus efforts
        - A clean, trustworthy forecast that eliminates the "dirty deals" problem
        </aside>
        
        <aside>
        <img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/star_yellow.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/star_yellow.svg" width="40px" />
        
        **2. Visual Deal Progression & Activity Timeline**
        
        The feature he was most excited about from competitive tools:
        
        - A **visual representation of deals in flight** showing stages, touchpoints, and activity
        - A **deal activity timeline board** that tracks progression over time
        - Immediate understanding of what's happening with each deal without clicking through multiple screens
        </aside>
        
        <aside>
        <img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/star_yellow.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/star_yellow.svg" width="40px" />
        
        **3. Actionable Next Steps (Not Just Data)**
        
        This is critical—Benjamin valued:
        
        - Real-time visibility into **what prospects are waiting on** (contracts, collateral, etc.)
        - **Recommended next actions** for reps to move deals forward
        - The ability to **see what needs to happen** without having to manually synthesize it himself
        </aside>
        
        <aside>
        <img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/star_yellow.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/star_yellow.svg" width="40px" />
        
        **4. Rep-Level Prioritization**
        
        With limited time, managers need to:
        
        - Quickly see which reps have the most pipeline at risk
        - Identify high-impact deals where coaching or intervention matters
        - Avoid wasting effort on reps who are fine
        </aside>
        
        <aside>
        <img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/star_yellow.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/star_yellow.svg" width="40px" />
        
        **5. Elimination of Manual Process Inefficiency**
        
        Benjamin flagged that current tools (HubSpot, manual reports) require:
        
        - Toggling between views to find what matters
        - Deep dives on every deal (inefficient with larger teams)
        - Manual compilation of status reports
        - A sales leader needs **one clean view** that answers: "What do I need to know right now?"
        </aside>
        
        The key advantage a solution like this has over HubSpot alone:
        
        - HubSpot is only as good as the AE using it
        - AskElephant's AI provides **granular, contextual insights** on deal momentum, health, and what specifically needs to happen next
        - It transforms raw data into **structured, actionable intelligence** that a leader can trust and act on

        ### **2. Proactive Coaching & Pipeline Management**
        
        - **Outcome**: Managers like James move from reactive to *proactive*—they know exactly where to intervene and help reps overcome obstacles in real-time.

        ## **Key Product Opportunities**
        
        ### **1. Out-of-the-Box Journey Templates** ⭐ (Quick Win)
        
        - **Opportunity**: Customers shouldn't spend 30 hours mapping their journey from scratch. Offer industry/use-case templates (SaaS, enterprise, SMB) as a starting point.
        - **Approach**:
            - Use their *own data* to analyze and suggest a draft journey (if they have existing data).
            - Let them customize from there.
            - Iterate every 3 months based on what they've learned.1
        - **Why It Matters**: Dramatically lowers barrier to entry and time-to-value.
        
        ### **2. Action-Driven Workspace (Replaces "My Meetings" Page)** ⭐ (High Impact)
        
        - **Opportunity**: Tear down the clunky "My Meetings" page. Build a new default view that shows:
            - **Right now**: Top 3-5 things you *must* do (not a list of 30).
            - **Why it matters**: Context snippet showing what's at stake.
            - **How to do it**: Draft email ready to review, pre-filled follow-up, etc.1
        - **Why It Matters**: This is where behavior change happens. Reps who see actionable next steps + context actually execute.
        
        ### **3. Milestone-Based Journey Stages** ⭐ (Core Architecture)
        
        - **Opportunity**: Replace rigid "stage progression" thinking with milestone-based tracking.
            - A deal can move to stage 2, but if a Stage 1 milestone isn't complete, flag it as *at risk*.
            - Track *per persona*, not just per company.
            - Acknowledge that customers loop back through stages (onboarding → expansion → onboarding again).1
        - **Why It Matters**: Reflects real customer behavior. Prevents reps from moving deals forward on false confidence.
        
        ### **4. Contextual Next Steps (AI-Driven Coaching)**
        
        - **Opportunity**: Surface not just "you have 27 follow-ups"—but "you're 3 calls in and haven't identified success criteria yet. That's the blocker. Here's how to fix it."
        - **Example**: "This deal is stuck because you never established ROI. Here's a question framework to do that. Schedule a follow-up call." 1
        - **Why It Matters**: Reps get smarter because AskElephant teaches them the *why* behind each action.
        
        ### **5. Proactive Manager Guidance & Alerts**
        
        - **Opportunity**: Show managers a "Rep Dashboard" that highlights:
            - Which reps have promised follow-ups they haven't done (alert).
            - Which deals are at risk because milestones aren't complete (coaching opportunity).
            - Which deals are set up for failure (need intervention now).
        - **Why It Matters**: James can be proactive instead of reactive. This is what makes AskElephant different from HubSpot.
        
        ### **6. Dynamic Personalization (Future Vision)**
        
        - **Opportunity**: Over time, customize guidance based on:
            - *Who* you're selling to (CS exec vs. RevOps persona = different playbook).
            - *Who* you're competing against (tailor messaging to win against Gong, etc.).
            - *Deal size* and complexity.1
        - **Why It Matters**: Long-term, this becomes the fully contextualized, intelligent assistant—not just a dashboard.

        ## Rep-Centric Priorities
        
        **Prospecting & Lead Management**
        
        - Which leads should I be talking to next
        - Which leads are engaged vs. disengaged (following out of Rules of Engagement)
        - Real-time visibility into lead status to avoid losing permission to work them
        
        **Deal Preparation & Execution**
        
        - Being prepared for upcoming demos
        - Visibility into action items committed to (did I actually do what I said I would?)
        - Multi-threading opportunities—AI monitoring online/LinkedIn to surface new contacts and angles to work with
        
        **Customer Health & Relationship Maintenance**
        
        - Post-close monitoring of customer onboarding experience
        - Customer health indicators to identify upsell/referral opportunities
        - Opportunity to maintain deeper relationships with closed customers
        
        [Woody remarks](https://app.askelephant.ai/workspaces/wrks_01JN30KSYSBMDRRVA3F62N2GHW/engagements/ngmt_01KD4VPWFBCCTT840HAQ6Z9XA9?chatId=chat_01KD4YTKY72W7KNPAF4QBMM4SX)

        ## Critical Design Considerations
        
        **Timeline & Process Metadata**
        
        - Where are we in the sales process? (First call? Third call?)
        - Timeline visibility is "super important"
        
        **Enriched Customer Views**
        
        - Current customer view feels "bare" and puts work on the rep's plate
        - About 60% of relevant company info (people, roles, engagement signals) should be surfaced proactively
        - Reps shouldn't have to ask a question to get value—the dashboard should show them something useful immediately
        
        **AI-Powered Insights Over Raw Data**
        
        - Reps are overwhelmed by traditional dashboards (Salesforce has "dashboards and dashboards")
        - The dashboard needs to surface *actionable intelligence*, not just data

        Pete emphasized: *The time-saver isn't just sending emails—it's the ability to quickly generate documents, see deal context, and know exactly what actions move deals forward.* Josh wants to see tasks, deals, coaching insights, and next steps all in one place without having to dig through CRM data.
        
        ### **Core Value Drivers For Sales Reps**

        <img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/star_yellow.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/star_yellow.svg" width="40px" />
        
        **1. Deal Pipeline View**
        
        - See all deals they're actively working
        - Instantly identify which deals have the highest probability of closing
        - Understand where each deal stands in the sales cycle
        </aside>

        <img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/star_yellow.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/star_yellow.svg" width="40px" />
        
        **2. Task Management (Prioritized)**
        
        - Tasks ranked by **likelihood to close** and **customer decision timeline**
        - Shows what needs to be done *right now* vs. later
        - Includes context: "What's the customer's timeline? When do they want to decide?"
        - Tasks ranked by urgency and impact (deals closing end-of-month prioritized highest)
        </aside>

        **3. Account Mapping**
        
        - Visual view of all stakeholders per deal
        - Identify: Champions, decision makers, influencers, economic buyers
        - Know who's been talked to and their buying influence
        - Example: "Zoya is my champion, Gabby is a decision maker and influencer, Mike (CEO) will follow when Gabby signs off"

        **4. Quick Action Items**
        
        - One-click ability to send emails or review generated content
        - Track: "Did that get done? What's the follow-up?"
        - See if waiting on customer response vs. internal action needed

        **5. Coaching & Deal Health Insights**
        
        - Flag deals at risk (e.g., "Pain wasn't agitated—relationship seller risk")
        - Show which deals need immediate attention vs. those progressing well
        </aside>
        
        ## How Sales Reps work:
        
        - **Time-blocked task management**: Pull tasks from calls → create task list → time-block into calendar for execution
        - **Per-deal focus**: Click into a specific deal, see all related tasks and stakeholders, work through them systematically
        - **Follow-up automation**: Track response windows (e.g., 3-day follow-up reminders if no response)
- CS Reps
    - Parker and Jasmin chat
        
        **The North Star Problem:** CS reps need a single place to see customer progress toward defined outcomes, not just workflow completion. Rather than generic stage tracking, they need visibility into whether outcomes are actually being achieved.
        
        Recording: [Discovery with Jasmin and Parker](https://app.askelephant.ai/workspaces/wrks_01JN30KSYSBMDRRVA3F62N2GHW/engagements/ngmt_01KD4VNHCW13KB29NMTW0BTVWR?chatId=chat_01KD4ZHG01JXK8YX5JBJC4GGV0)
        
        Customer → Outcomes/Milestones → Tasks (tied to each outcome)
        
        Jasmin framed it perfectly: AskElephant should increase CSM capacity *not* by automating CSMs away, but by freeing them to do the *irreplaceable* work – strategic thinking, relationship deepening, and discovery that unearths new value.

        ## **Prioritization at Scale**
        
        When CS capacity scales (30+ customers, sometimes treated as 60-90 accounts across divisions), mental tracking breaks down. The dashboard must surface importance-based prioritization:
        
        - **Maintain vs. Risk vs. Grow** account classification
        - **Revenue impact** (expansion vs. maintenance)
        - **Timeline urgency** (project due dates + renewal dates)
        - **Account value** (contract size) weighted against effort
        
        **Parker's insight:** By offloading mental tracking, reps have cognitive space to focus on *strategic alignment and in-the-moment discovery* rather than remembering what happened.

        ## **Actionability Over Information**
        
        **The critical ask:** "Help me, AskElephant. Just cut through the complexity and bullshit. Just help me know what I freaking need to do."
        
        - Tasks should be tied to outcomes (not disconnected to-dos)
        - Next steps should be visible *before* the call (prep) and *after* the call (action items)
        - AskElephant should **suggest actions** (e.g., "send follow-up," "schedule next touchpoint") so reps approve, not create from scratch

        ## **Preserve the Human Elements**
        
        Jasmin emphasized what should **NOT** be automated, as these differentiate good CS from mediocre CS:
        
        - **North Star alignment** – Realigning customers when they drift toward nice-to-haves vs. strategic outcomes
        - **In-the-moment discovery** – Asking "why" repeatedly to uncover hidden drivers and new expansion/risk signals
        - **Timing & EQ** – Knowing *when* to ask for expansion, when to save an at-risk account, when to push back
        - **Strategic reinvestment** – Translating customer wins into new outcomes, not just checking boxes

        “When a customer is going through to configure their customer journey, and we want to adjust whatever existing data they have to help kind of set that up, have you shown me an example of just the technicality that happened and the amount of back and forth through the entire leadership channel of just figuring out, like, what people can check, I'm thinking how incredible would it be to use that Slack data of conversations, alignment, and agreeance on process. A lot of that happens in Slack.”
