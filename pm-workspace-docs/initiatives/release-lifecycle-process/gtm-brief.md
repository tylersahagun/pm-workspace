   Every Monday, you'll know what's changed and what's coming

3. **"One source of truth"**  
   Notion doc + Slack channel + weekly meeting = you'll always know

4. **"Beta badge = set expectations"**  
   If you see a beta badge, so will the customer

   Get access to new features before general release

   Beta features evolve based on what you tell us

   Beta badge means "this may change" — no surprises

4. **"Easy control"**  
   Turn features on or off anytime in Settings

## Competitive Positioning

### Beta Program Comparison

| Company | Beta Program | Self-Serve | User Control |
|---------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| Gong | Invite only | ❌ | ❌ |
| Chorus | None public | ❌ | ❌ |
| Clari | Enterprise only | ❌ | ❌ |
| **AskElephant** | Open beta + self-serve | ✅ | ✅ |

### Differentiation
- **Transparency:** We show you exactly what stage a feature is in
- **Control:** You decide what betas to try, not us
- **Speed:** We ship faster because you can try things earlier

## Customer-Facing Launch Plan

### Launch Tier: P2

**Justification:**
- Self-serve beta is a notable feature
- Differentiates from competitors
- Worth a product email mention + KB article
- Not worth full campaign (internal process)

| Product email | ✅ | Kenzie | Feature in monthly update |
| Social post | 🟡 Maybe | Marketing | LinkedIn mention |
| In-app notification | ✅ | Product | Point to Settings |
| KB article | ✅ | Tyler | "How to use Beta Features" |
| CS talking points | ✅ | Tyler | How to introduce to customers |

### Launch Timeline

| Milestone | Date | Activity |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Beta UI ships | Mar 1 | In-app notification + KB article |

## CS Talking Points

### When to Mention Beta Program

- Customer asks about upcoming features
- Customer is a power user who'd appreciate early access
- Customer is frustrated about feature gap (beta might address it)

### How to Introduce

> "Did you know we have a Beta Program? You can try new features before they're released to everyone. Just go to Settings → Beta Features. If you see something with a Beta badge, that means it's still being refined, but we'd love your feedback!"

### When NOT to Mention

- Customer is struggling with core features
- Customer has complained about instability
- Feature they need is in Lab (not ready for external)

## Metrics to Track

### Internal Adoption

| Metric | Target | How |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Revenue team awareness | >90% | Survey |
| Weekly release notes attendance | >80% | Meeting attendance |
| Feature availability questions | Decrease | Support ticket tags |

### Customer Adoption (Post Beta UI)

| Metric | Target | How |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Beta settings page views | >20% of users | PostHog |
| Beta feature opt-in rate | >5% | PostHog |
| Beta feature feedback | Track volume | Intercom tags |

---

## Open Questions

1. **Beta program name:** Just "Beta Features" or give it a name? ("AskElephant Labs"?)
2. **Customer communication:** Announce beta program broadly or let it spread organically?
3. **Incentives:** Any recognition for beta participants? (Early adopter badge?)
4. **Feedback mechanism:** Build in-app feedback or use existing channels?

---

## Summary

| Component | Tier | Key Activities |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| Internal enablement | P3 | Training, docs, weekly notes |
| Beta UI launch | P2 | Product email, KB article, in-app notification |

Focus is on **internal process adoption first**, then **soft launch of customer-facing beta program** without major marketing investment.
