# GTM Brief: Feature Flag Cleanup

## Overview

**This is a purely technical initiative with minimal GTM requirements.**

The Feature Flag Cleanup focuses on removing technical debt from the codebase. There is no external marketing or customer communication needed.

---

## Launch Tier: P4 (Internal Only)

**Justification:**
- Pure technical debt cleanup
- No customer-visible changes
- No competitive differentiation
- Internal engineering improvement only

---

## Communication Plan

### External Communication
- ❌ No press release
- ❌ No blog post
- ❌ No email to customers
- ❌ No social media
- ❌ No in-app notification

### Internal Communication

| Audience | What to Communicate | Channel | When |
|----------|---------------------|---------|------|
| Engineering | Flags being removed | Slack #engineering | Per phase |
| CS | "We cleaned up tech debt" | Slack #product-updates | On completion |
| All company | Brief mention | All-hands | Quarterly |

## Talking Points (If Asked)

If a customer or internal stakeholder asks about feature flag cleanup:

> "We're doing routine maintenance to clean up our codebase. This makes the product more reliable and helps us ship features faster. You shouldn't notice any changes—we're only removing features that were never launched or are already available to everyone."
