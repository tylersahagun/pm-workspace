# GTM Brief: Feature Availability & Release Process

## Overview

## Value Proposition

### Internal (Primary)
> "Never demo a feature the customer can't use. Never learn about a change from a customer."

### Customer-Facing (Secondary)
> "Take control of your AskElephant experience with self-serve beta features."

## Key Messages

### For Revenue Team (Internal)

1. **"Same product, same experience"** - What you see is what customers see (except clearly marked betas)
2. **"Weekly release notes"** - Tyler will keep you updated every week on what's changed
3. **"No more surprises"** - Slack channel + Notion doc always has current state
4. **"Ask for beta access"** - If a customer wants a beta feature, you can enable it

### For Customers (When Beta UI Ships)

1. **"Be an early adopter"** - Get access to new features before general release
2. **"Clear expectations"** - Beta badge means "this may change"
3. **"Your feedback matters"** - Help shape features before they're final
4. **"Easy opt-out"** - Don't like it? Turn it off anytime

## Launch Tier Recommendation

### Tier: P3 (Internal/Low-Touch)

**Justification:**
- This is primarily internal process improvement
- Beta toggle UI is incremental, not transformational
- No competitive urgency
- Customer benefit is indirect (better support/consistency)

### Launch Activities

| Activity | Do It? | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Press release | ❌ No | Internal process, not newsworthy |
| Blog post | ❌ No | Maybe internal blog for culture |
| Social media | ❌ No | Not relevant |
| Email to customers | 🟡 Maybe | Brief mention in product update email |
| In-app notification | ✅ Yes | When beta toggle UI ships |
| Knowledge base article | ✅ Yes | How to use beta features |
| CSM talking points | ✅ Yes | How to explain beta program |
| Sales deck update | 🟡 Maybe | Mention beta program if relevant |

## Open Questions

1. **Customer communication:** Do we announce beta program to customers, or let them discover it?
2. **Beta program branding:** Should we name it? ("AskElephant Labs"? "Early Access"?)
3. **Feedback mechanism:** Build in-app feedback or use existing channels?
4. **Success stories:** Should we highlight customers using beta features?

---

## Summary

This is a **P3 internal launch** focused on:

1. **Internal enablement:** Training + documentation for Revenue team
2. **Communication infrastructure:** Weekly notes + Slack channel + Notion
3. **Low-touch customer launch:** In-app notification + KB article when beta UI ships

No external marketing required. Success = Revenue team confidence + consistent customer experience.
