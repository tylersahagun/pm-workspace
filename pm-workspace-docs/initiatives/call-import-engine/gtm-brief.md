# GTM Brief: Call Import Engine

## Value Proposition

**AskElephant makes switching from Gong, Grain, or other call platforms painless—bring your historical calls with you and get AI-powered insights from day one, not after weeks of waiting.**

---

## Target Segment

### Primary: Competitive Switches
- Teams currently using Gong, Chorus, or Grain who are evaluating AskElephant
- Concerned about losing historical data and context
- Often have 5,000–50,000+ calls to migrate
- Deal size: Mid-market to enterprise

### Secondary: Multi-Platform Consolidation
- Teams using multiple recording tools (RingCentral for phone, Zoom for video)
- Want unified visibility across all conversation types
- RevOps-driven, focused on data consistency

### Tertiary: New Customer Onboarding
- Any new customer with existing call recordings
- Reduces "zero-state" friction during onboarding
- Accelerates time-to-value

---

## Key Messages

### For Sales (External Pitch)

1. **"Your data comes with you."**
   We import your historical calls from Gong, Grain, and 10+ other platforms—so you're not starting from scratch.

2. **"See value from day one."**
   Don't wait for your first recorded call. Your team can query, search, and analyze historical conversations immediately.

3. **"No engineering project required."**
   Our support team handles the import end-to-end. You give us access; we deliver your data.

4. **"We've done this before."**
   [X] customers have migrated [Y] calls from [platforms]. It works.

### For CS (Internal Enablement)

1. **"Check the matrix first."**
   Before promising anything, confirm the platform is supported and note the expected timeline.

2. **"Set expectations on capabilities."**
   Imported calls are searchable and playable with transcripts. Some AI features may be limited depending on metadata quality.

3. **"Escalate volume concerns."**
   Imports over 20K calls require timeline discussion with engineering. Don't promise same-week delivery.

## Competitive Positioning

### vs. Gong
- "Gong makes it hard to leave. We make it easy to switch. Your calls are your data."
- Note: Gong's API is rate-limited (10K/day). Large imports take time.

### vs. Grain
- "Already using Grain? We can import your entire library—like Noah did with 5,000 calls."
- Strong POC story to reference.

### vs. Starting Fresh
- "Why lose years of customer conversation history? Import it and let AI find patterns across all your calls."

---

## Customer Impact

### Immediate Benefits
- **Reduced time-to-value:** Customers see AskElephant working on real data within days, not weeks
- **Lower switching cost:** Data migration is handled, not a customer project
- **Confidence in decision:** "We can always go back" fear is addressed

### Long-Term Benefits
- **Historical insights:** AI can analyze patterns across years of calls
- **Complete customer journey:** Sales-to-CS handoff context is preserved
- **Better coaching foundation:** Leaders can review historical calls, not just new ones

## Launch Tier Recommendation

### Tier: P1 (Internal Launch)

**Justification:**
- v1 has no customer-facing UI; this is infrastructure
- Enables sales/CS to confidently sell and onboard
- No public announcement needed
- Success measured by internal efficiency, not external adoption

### Launch Activities

| Activity | Owner | Timing |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Platform matrix published | Tyler | Week 1 |
| Sales enablement session | Tyler + CS Lead | Week 2 |
| CS runbook training | Eduardo + Support Lead | Week 2 |
| First customer import (Noah/Grain) | Eduardo | Week 1-2 |
| Success metrics baseline | Tyler | Week 3 |

### Future P0 Launch (v2)
When we add customer self-service portal:
- Marketing announcement
- Product update email
- Website feature page
- Case study publication

## Pricing Considerations

> See full analysis in research.md

### Recommended Approach

| Scenario | Pricing |
|----------|---------|
| Included in deal | Enterprise deals, competitive switches (migration assistance) |
| Flat fee | $500–1,000 for imports under 5,000 calls |
| Per-call rate | $0.50–1.00/call for larger imports |
| Continuous sync | 2–3x historical import (separate SKU discussion) |

### Positioning
- "We absorb migration costs for committed customers"
- "Small fee covers processing for one-time historical imports"
- NOT a profit center—a competitive advantage

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Competitive win rate (with import) | +10% vs. without | CRM tracking |
| Onboarding CSAT (import customers) | >8/10 | Survey |
| Time to value (import customers) | <7 days | First meaningful action after import |
| Import request fulfillment | 100% (supported platforms) | Internal tracking |
| Sales confidence (qualitative) | "I can confidently answer import questions" | Sales feedback |

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Over-promising capabilities | Clear messaging on what imported calls can/can't do |
| Platform not supported | "Manual upload" fallback; clear no with explanation |
| Timeline misses | Buffer expectations; communicate proactively |
| Competitor lockdown (tighter APIs) | Monitor; document workarounds; consider bucket drop |

## Key Dates

| Milestone | Target Date |
|-----------|-------------|
| Grain POC complete | Mid-January 2026 |
| Platform matrix v1 | End of January 2026 |
