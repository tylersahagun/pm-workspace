**Situation:**

The last two weeks we have gotten 4 requests for call imports that range from 20,000-50,000 calls each. Some of these requests have already been paid for, others are just requests. The number and SIZE of these requests is quickly growing.

**Complexity:**

- Importing calls of this volume is time consuming and costly
- We don't have a true idea of the cost of call imports when workflows, transcriptions, and data storage is all considered
- Calls are stored in third-party platforms which a wide range of access permissions and meta-data (i.e. emails, contacts, speakers, transcripts...)
- Having access to so many calls really only serves as storage. Getting insights or analysis from that many calls is nearly impossible today. This may lead to unrealistic expectations and underwhelming adoption
- In order to avoid overwhelming our servers these imports can only be done at night. They also have to be done in such a way that the rate is about 5,000 per 12 hours.

**Solution:** _@Revenue_

Create a well defined expectation for clients on what can be done with imported calls

Outline pricing and timeframes if this is something that will be done moving forward

Determine if our benefits for doing imports actually outweighs the costs (storage, time, development lift, and product perception)

_@Engineering_ Develop rules for rate limits and imports so we can optimize speed and cost

@Me Find true cost of imports Outline dev lift
