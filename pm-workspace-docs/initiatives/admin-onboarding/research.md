# Research: Admin Onboarding

## Summary
Admin onboarding focuses on the workspace setup experience for administrators, with CRM connection as the first and most critical touchpoint. Bryan is taking initial responsibility with handoff to Jason for ownership.

## Source
- **Meeting:** Product Planning Session
- **Date:** 2026-01-16
- **Participants:** Woody, Tyler, Bryan, Skylar

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: CRM Connection is First Admin Experience
**Status:** Confirmed
**Details:**
> "Admin onboarding will actually relate closely to this [CRM] because one of the first things we wanna do is have the experience of CRM. In the beginning of that experience, I would think, is admin onboarding."

> "Onboarding includes all integrations, but the most important one is the CRM."

**Implications:**
- Admin onboarding and CRM EtoE are tightly coupled
- Must design admin flow around integration setup
- CRM success = admin onboarding success

### Decision 2: CS Collaboration Required
**Status:** Pending
**Details:**
> "Use where the... we're working with our team, the admin, typically, our onboarding admins and diagram on that onboarding flow, see where the CRM piece fits in. And then when you have that diagram, we could pick and choose those starting bricks to deploy."

**Action:** Work with CS to diagram the workspace onboarding flow

### Decision 3: Jason Taking Ownership
**Status:** Confirmed
**Details:**
> "I'm gonna talk to Jason. He's gonna have extreme ownership of this, and I wanna make sure he understands that."

**Handoff:** Bryan → Jason

## Open Questions
1. What are all the steps in the current CS-led admin onboarding flow?
2. Which integration setup (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.) should be prioritized?
3. How does admin onboarding differ by customer segment (SMB vs mid-market)?
4. What are the "small bricks" we can ship today while building the full flow?
