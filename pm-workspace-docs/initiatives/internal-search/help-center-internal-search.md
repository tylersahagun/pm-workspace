## What is Internal Search?

Internal Search lets you ask questions about your customer conversations in plain English. Instead of manually hunting through meeting recordings, transcripts, and notes, simply ask what you need to know—and AskElephant finds it for you.

**Think of it as Google for your customer conversations**, but smarter. It understands what you mean, not just the exact words you type.

## How to Enable Internal Search

1. Open any chat in AskElephant
2. Click the **Tools** button (puzzle piece icon) in the chat composer
3. Find **"Internal Search"** with the purple database icon
4. Toggle it **ON**

Once enabled, AskElephant will automatically use Internal Search when your questions are about your meeting history, customers, or team.

## Pro Tips for Better Results

### 1. Be Specific About Time
Instead of broad searches, add time context:
- ❌ "Show me Acme meetings"
- ✅ "Show me Acme meetings from the last 2 weeks"

### 2. Use Natural Language
You don't need special syntax. Ask like you're asking a colleague:
- ❌ "query: acme AND objection"  
- ✅ "What objections did Acme raise in our recent calls?"

### 3. Search by Meaning, Not Just Words
Internal Search uses semantic search—it understands concepts:
- Searching for "pricing concerns" will also find discussions about "cost", "budget", "too expensive", etc.

### 4. Combine Filters Naturally
You can mix entity types and time ranges:
- "Show me Sarah's meetings with enterprise accounts last month where security was discussed"

### 5. Follow Up for Details
Start broad, then drill down:
1. "Show me recent meetings with CloudCorp"
2. "What were the action items from the January 10th call?"
3. "Read me the part where they discussed timeline"
