## Problem Statement


When customers switch from Gong, Grain, or other call recording platforms to AskElephant, they face a frustrating experience:

> "When I was onboarding, it was really hard to show someone the platform... The conversation was literally like, 'When is your next call?' Looks like you have a call tomorrow at twelve. So over twenty-four hours passed..." — Tyler
