## Problem Statement

Reps and leaders are overwhelmed by noisy alerts that lack context, making it hard to know what to do next in a deal. They need a story-like summary of where a customer is in their journey, why it matters, and what actions move the deal forward. The current view feels like pipeline status, not a guided path tailored to the customer’s journey, and it does not reflect the product channel context that changes how the journey should be interpreted.
