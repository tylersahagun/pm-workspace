## Problem Statement


Sales leaders have rich conversational data across thousands of calls but no way to systematically extract, filter, and aggregate insights. Currently:

- **Insights are locked in transcripts** requiring manual review or one-off AI queries
- **Signal configuration is burdensome** (2+ hours for complex setups like School AI's 25 annotations)
