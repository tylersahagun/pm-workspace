## Problem Statement

**Who:** New customers setting up workflows

**What:** Start from blank slate, don't know what workflows to create

**When:** During onboarding and initial configuration

**Impact:** Longer time-to-value, CSM dependency, potential churn if overwhelmed

> One-sentence summary: As a new customer, I don't know what workflows to create when starting with a blank slate, which causes longer setup time and dependency on CSM guidance.

## Assessment

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Severity** | High | Affects time-to-value and CSM efficiency |
| **Frequency** | Common | Every customer needs workflows |
| **Personas Affected** | RevOps, Admin, Sales leader | Anyone configuring the platform |
| **Evidence Strength** | Strong | 16+ documented workflow patterns |

---

## Outcome Chain

If we create workflow templates from customer patterns:

```
Pre-built workflow templates (Sentiment Score, CRM Update, Objection Extraction)
  → so that customers can start with proven patterns
    → so that time-to-value decreases from weeks to days
      → so that CSM calls focus on optimization, not basic setup
        → so that adoption increases and churn decreases
```
