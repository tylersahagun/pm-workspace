## Problem Statement

**Who:** Sales reps, AEs, and the go-to-market team

**What:** AskElephant lacks a clear "anchor point" that makes the product easy to demo, understand, and adopt

**When:** During sales demos, onboarding, and daily rep workflow

**Impact:** Without a clear entry point, reps don't know where to "live" in AskElephant, demos are harder, and virality is limited

> One-sentence summary: As a sales rep, I struggle to understand where to start with AskElephant because there's no clear "home base" that shows me my deals and what to do next, which causes slower adoption and weaker demo stories.

## Assessment

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Severity** | High | Affects demo effectiveness, time-to-value, and viral potential |
| **Frequency** | Common | Every new customer needs clear entry point |
| **Personas Affected** | Sales reps, AEs | Primary; Sales leaders for team adoption |
| **Evidence Strength** | Strong | Leadership + customer evidence aligned |

---

## Outcome Chain

If we solve this problem:

```
Rep Workspace as clear anchor point
  → so that reps know exactly where to start each day
    → so that demos become clearer and more compelling
      → so that time-to-value decreases and win rates improve
        → so that viral adoption increases and NRR improves
```

## Validation Criteria

To move from `active` → `validated`:
- [x] 3+ independent evidence sources (leadership + customer + internal)
- [x] Clear persona identification (sales reps, AEs)
- [x] Severity/frequency assessed
- [x] Outcome chain articulated

To move from `validated` → `committed`:
- [ ] Prioritized against alternatives
- [x] Owner assigned (Brian + Rob)
- [x] Capacity allocated (hackathon priority)
- [x] Initiative created (rep-workspace exists)

## Potential Solutions

1. **Deal-centric dashboard** - Mirror HubSpot pipeline in AskElephant
2. **Proactive task list** - AI-generated "what to do next" for each deal
3. **Composio actions** - Execute tasks directly from workspace
4. **Smart insights** - Context-aware suggestions beyond explicit action items
