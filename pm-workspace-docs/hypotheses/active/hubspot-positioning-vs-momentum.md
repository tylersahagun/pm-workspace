## Problem Statement

**Who:** HubSpot customers evaluating revenue intelligence tools

**What:** Momentum requires Salesforce, creating an opening for AskElephant with HubSpot shops

**When:** During competitive evaluation when HubSpot is the CRM

**Impact:** Clear differentiation opportunity; Momentum is automatically ruled out for HubSpot customers

> One-sentence summary: As a HubSpot customer evaluating revenue intelligence tools, I can't use Momentum (Salesforce required), which creates a clear opportunity for AskElephant to win these deals.
