## Problem Statement

**Who:** Sales teams evaluating AskElephant vs Gong

**What:** See Gong as expensive/overkill when they primarily need automation over coaching

**When:** During competitive evaluation when automation is their primary use case

**Impact:** AskElephant wins deals when automation positioning is clear; loses when defaulting to "also-ran" positioning

> One-sentence summary: As a sales leader who values automation over coaching, I choose AskElephant over Gong when the automation differentiation is clearly communicated, which drives wins in our best-fit segment.
