## Problem Statement

**Who:** Sales reps working deals

**What:** Current action item extraction only captures explicit statements; reps miss implicit opportunities to advance deals

**When:** After calls, during deal review, when planning next steps

**Impact:** Reps rely on intuition rather than AI-powered guidance for strategic deal moves, leading to missed opportunities and longer sales cycles

> One-sentence summary: As a sales rep, I struggle to know what I SHOULD be doing to advance a deal (beyond what was explicitly discussed) because AskElephant only extracts stated action items, which causes me to miss strategic opportunities.

## Evidence

### Signal 1: Internal Product Meeting - 2026-01-24
- **Source:** transcript
- **Link:** `signals/transcripts/2026-01-24-council-of-product.md`
- **Quote:** "Where I really wanna hit is that taking the full context, suggesting and covering hashtags that you may not that weren't spoken, that weren't more in terms of things you should do to carry a deal for them."
- **Interpretation:** Leadership wants to move beyond explicit action items to proactive deal guidance.

### Signal 2: Internal Product Meeting - 2026-01-24
- **Source:** transcript
- **Link:** `signals/transcripts/2026-01-24-council-of-product.md`
- **Quote:** "What I'm trying to prove here is the next milestone is that, one, we can take the data and now have it in ours. And then based off that data and the full context of the entity, we can actually drive real actual insights of things that they should be doing."
- **Interpretation:** The goal is AI that understands deal context and generates strategic recommendations.

### Signal 3: Partner Feedback - 2026-01-21
- **Source:** transcript
- **Link:** `signals/transcripts/2026-01-21-crispy-product-feedback-session.md`
- **Quote:** "CRM reporting doesn't answer 'so what?'"
- **Interpretation:** Current insights lack actionability - partners want guidance on what to DO, not just what happened.

## Assessment

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Severity** | High | Core value prop differentiation from commodity note-takers |
| **Frequency** | Common | Every deal, every rep, every day |
| **Personas Affected** | Sales reps | Primary; Sales leaders for coaching insights |
| **Evidence Strength** | Moderate | Leadership direction + partner feedback |

---

## Outcome Chain

If we solve this problem:

```
Proactive deal intelligence (beyond explicit action items)
  → so that reps receive AI-generated strategic suggestions
    → so that they take actions that weren't explicitly stated but are strategic
      → so that deal velocity increases and win rates improve
        → so that revenue outcomes are delivered (outcome chain fulfillment)
```

## Validation Criteria

To move from `active` → `validated`:
- [x] 3+ independent evidence sources
- [x] Clear persona identification (sales reps)
- [x] Severity/frequency assessed
- [x] Outcome chain articulated

To move from `validated` → `committed`:
- [ ] Prioritized against alternatives
- [ ] Owner assigned
- [ ] Capacity allocated
- [x] Initiative connection (rep-workspace)

---

## Potential Solutions

1. **Deal context analysis** - AI reviews full deal history (not just last call)
2. **Strategic suggestion engine** - "Based on this deal stage, consider..."
3. **Pattern matching** - "Deals like this that won did X"
4. **Gap detection** - "You haven't discussed pricing/timeline/decision maker"
5. **Composio-powered actions** - Not just suggestions, but executable tasks

## Differentiation from Competitors

This is where we diverge from commodity note-takers:
- **Generic AI:** "Here's what was said"
- **AskElephant:** "Here's what you should DO next, and here's why"

Aligns with product vision anti-vision:
> "We're NOT building generic AI summaries without action/outcome orientation."
