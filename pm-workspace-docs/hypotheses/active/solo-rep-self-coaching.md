## Problem Statement

**Who:** Solo sales reps (sales team of one)

**What:** Lack of self-coaching tools; existing coaching features assume a manager/team structure

**When:** After calls, when trying to improve performance without a manager to review

**Impact:** Solo reps can't systematically improve their sales skills using AskElephant; they resort to manual transcript review or external tools

> One-sentence summary: As a solo sales rep, I struggle with improving my sales performance when I have no manager to coach me, which causes me to miss opportunities for self-improvement and slower skill development.

## Evidence

### Signal 1: Customer Feedback - 2026-01-21
- **Source:** transcript
- **Link:** `signals/transcripts/2026-01-21-maple-billing-feedback.md`
- **Quote:** "I am a sales team of one, so that's where my workflows are maybe, like, very much predicated upon that... I'm actually way more interested in coaching from the aspect of, like, cool. Pull out some the common questions that have been asked across all my transcripts. Pull out, like, the key details of where I could have adjusted this. And so it's more self coaching than it is monitoring."
- **Interpretation:** Solo reps have distinct needs from team reps - they want self-reflection and pattern recognition across their own calls, not manager oversight or team comparison.

### Signal 2: Customer Feedback - 2026-01-21 (same source)
- **Source:** transcript
- **Link:** `signals/transcripts/2026-01-21-maple-billing-feedback.md`
- **Quote:** "Pull out some the common questions that have been asked across all my transcripts. Pull out, like, the key details of where I could have adjusted this."
- **Interpretation:** Specific feature request: aggregate analysis across all their calls to find patterns and improvement opportunities. This is different from per-call coaching.

## Assessment

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Severity** | Medium | Solo reps can still use AskElephant, but coaching value is reduced |
| **Frequency** | Occasional | Solo reps are a subset of all reps |
| **Personas Affected** | Solo sales rep | Primary; may also apply to small team reps |
| **Evidence Strength** | Moderate | 1 customer source, but quote is very specific |

## Outcome Chain

If we solve this problem:

```
Self-coaching tools for solo reps
  → so that solo reps can identify patterns across their calls
    → so that they improve their sales technique without manager oversight
      → so that win rates improve for solo rep customers
        → so that retention increases for SMB/solo customers
```

## Validation Criteria

To move from `active` → `validated`:
- [ ] 3+ independent evidence sources (currently: 1)
- [x] Clear persona identification (solo sales rep)
- [x] Severity/frequency assessed
- [x] Outcome chain articulated

To move from `validated` → `committed`:
- [ ] Prioritized against alternatives
- [ ] Owner assigned
- [ ] Capacity allocated
- [ ] Initiative created (or added to rep-workspace scope)

## Potential Solutions

1. **Cross-call pattern analysis** - "What questions do I get asked most?"
2. **Self-coaching prompts** - "Where could I have improved in this call?"
3. **Personal performance trends** - "Am I getting better at handling objections?"
4. **Call comparison** - "How did this discovery call compare to my best ones?"
5. **Aggregate insights** - "What topics do I struggle with across all deals?"
