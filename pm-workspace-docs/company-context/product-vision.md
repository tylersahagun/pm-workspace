# AskElephant Product Vision

## Core Identity

> "Taking unstructured data from one place and giving it to the right person at the right time and the right format." — Woody Klemetson, CEO (All Hands, Jan 6, 2026)

AskElephant is a **revenue outcome system**—not a note-taker. We convert conversation + operational context into reliable actions, risk detection, and execution, while keeping humans at the center. AI orchestrates outcomes; it doesn't replace people.

### The Outcome Chain

```
Capture meetings consistently
  → so that AskElephant has all meaningful data
    → so that users are alerted when deals are in bad state
      → so that they reduce time on bad deals
        → so that they have faster time to close
          → so that they have higher quota capacity
            → so that revenue outcomes are delivered
```

## Mission

Help revenue teams never miss what matters in customer conversations—and turn that into **executed outcomes**, not just captured information.

> "I wanna build an AI that leaves no human behind..." — Woody Klemetson, CEO (All Hands, Jan 6, 2026)

---

## Core Value Props

1. **Never miss what matters** - AI captures key moments automatically
2. **Context at your fingertips** - Searchable, structured conversation history
3. **Automatic follow-ups** - Actions pushed to CRM without manual work
4. **Coaching at scale** - Leaders review efficiently, coach proactively

---

## What We're Building (Strategic Pillars - V3)

1. **Customer Trust** - Privacy determination, capture visibility, transparency
2. **Data Knowledge** - Rep/company stats, journey tracking, structured insights
3. **Trend Visibility** - Rep performance insights, analytics, pattern detection

---

## 2026 Strategic Initiatives

From leadership (Council of Product, approved going into 2026):

1. **Workflow Builder / AI Assistant Tool** - External launch of automation capabilities
2. **Privacy Determination Agent** - Classify privacy before workflows trigger (trust foundation)
3. **Desktop Recording v2** - Reliability fallback beyond bots
4. **Global Chat** - AI-first interface; fewer toggle/settings paradigms
5. **CRM Agent Upgrades** - Support current-state workflows while building future

## Product Principles

### 1. Outcomes > Outputs

> "It's not what you build...It's how it's delivered, how it's used, and how it is experienced." — Woody Klemetson, CEO

Build for business outcomes (quota capacity, win rates, retention), not feature counts. Every feature must have a clear "so that..." chain to a measurable outcome.

### 2. Human-Centered AI (Orchestration, Not Replacement)

> "If you are not helping orchestrate a human outcome, then you are not working on the right thing." — Woody Klemetson, CEO

AI takes the "legos" (repetitive, structured tasks). Humans focus on judgment, relationships, and work that actually moves outcomes.

### 3. Trust Is Foundational

Trust and reliability must be solved _before_ automation can be adopted at scale. This means:

- Privacy visibility and control
- Capture consistency and reliability
- Transparency in how AI works

### 4. Standardization Beats Intuition

> "We need to learn to...slow down first." — Leadership (Product discipline discussion)

Consistency is the product. Capture must be consistent before AI can safely drive coaching/insights. Repeatable execution improves forecast reliability.

### 5. AI-First UX

> "Your settings are not toggles anymore...It's a chat...AI first." — Leadership (Product direction discussion)

Configure through intent and conversation, not buried settings pages. The interface becomes fluid and conversational.

### 6. Quality Over Velocity

Leadership explicitly allocates capacity to quality vs. feature velocity. Ship less, increase reliability. A reliable foundation enables faster future iteration.

---

## Target Market

- **Primary:** Mid-market B2B sales teams (50-500 employees)
- **Secondary:** Customer Success teams at B2B SaaS companies
- **Focus:** Revenue teams who need consistent capture + structured insights to improve coaching, forecasting, and outcomes

---

## The Moat (What Makes Us Defensible)

> "Technology is not a moat...It matters about the outcome that what they build delivers." — Woody Klemetson, CEO

Our moat is NOT features or LLM capabilities. It's:

1. **Go-to-Market** - How we deliver and support
2. **Customer Experience** - The end-to-end journey
3. **Brand & Community** - Trust built over time
4. **Outcome Delivery** - Repeatability, orchestration, reliability

---

## Success Metrics

### Proof of Value (What Leadership Watches)

> "50% of our revenue growth this year came from current customers..." — Woody Klemetson, CEO (All Hands, Jan 6, 2026)

> "We added almost a million dollars of ARR in three months..." — Robert Henderson, CEO (All Hands, Jan 6, 2026)

**Expansion + compounding growth** as proof of product-market resonance. Land-and-expand is the core validation loop.

### Trust North Star (Leading Indicators)

> "Users are so confident that AskElephant is their trusted personal adviser for privacy that they delegate all privacy concerns to the platform." — Privacy Determination Agent project framing

- Manual privacy toggles decrease (trust increases)
- Executive calls recorded increase (confidence increases)
- Bots kicked mid-session decrease (reliability increases)

### Outcome Metrics (Lagging Indicators)

- Faster time-to-close
- Higher quota capacity
- Better coaching inputs/outputs
- Improved win rates
- NRR/retention improvements

---

## What We're NOT Building (Anti-Vision)

Leadership consistently distances us from:

- **Feature-for-feature parity** with note-takers (we're not competing on transcripts)
- **Generic AI summaries** without action/outcome orientation
- **Technology as the product** (the experience and delivery are the product)
- **Me-too features** that any competitor could build
- **Automation without trust** (must solve privacy/visibility first)

---

## The One-Liner

**AskElephant turns customer conversations into trusted, structured insights and actions that drive GTM outcomes.**

---

## The Bet

> "Standardization + trust + structured domain intelligence beats generic AI output; reliability is the moat."

We believe that solving **trust, visibility, and consistent capture** unlocks the next wave of AI-driven execution—and that's a harder problem than "better summaries."

---

## Open Questions (For Leadership)

1. What is the **explicit single North Star metric** if we had to pick just one?
2. What is the canonical **anti-vision statement** we can quote and share?
3. What is the explicit **12-24 month market segmentation** priority (SMB vs mid-market vs enterprise)?
