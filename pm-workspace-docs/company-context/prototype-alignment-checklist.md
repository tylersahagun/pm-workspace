# Prototype Alignment Checklist

Before building any prototype, run through these questions to ensure alignment with product vision.

> **Note**: Fill in the [PLACEHOLDER] sections after running the product vision research prompt.

---

## Quick Gut Check (30 seconds)

- [ ] Does this feel like "AskElephant" or could any competitor build this?
- [ ] Would [IDEAL CUSTOMER PERSONA] care about this tomorrow?
- [ ] Is this invisible until valuable, or does it add friction?

---

## Strategic Alignment (2 minutes)

### Mission Fit
- [ ] Does this help revenue teams "never miss what matters"?
- [ ] Which core value prop does this strengthen?
  - [ ] Never miss what matters
  - [ ] Context at your fingertips
  - [ ] Automatic follow-ups
  - [ ] Coaching at scale

### Persona Alignment
- [ ] Who is this for? _______________
- [ ] Is this persona in our target market (mid-market B2B sales/CS)?
- [ ] Does this solve a top-3 problem for them?

### Product Principles Check
- [ ] **Invisible until valuable** - Does capture/setup happen automatically?
- [ ] **Context-aware** - Does it adapt to what matters to each user?
- [ ] **Action-oriented** - Does it drive specific behavior change?
- [ ] **Transparent** - Can users understand why/how it works?

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Before proceeding, confirm this prototype does NOT:

- [ ] Require significant user setup before showing value
- [ ] Add steps to existing workflows without clear payoff
- [ ] Build features competitors already have (me-too features)
- [ ] Optimize for vanity metrics over real outcomes
- [ ] [ADD FROM RESEARCH: Things leadership has said we won't build]

## Success Criteria

Define before building:

1. **User outcome**: What can users do after that they couldn't before?
   > _______________

2. **Measurable signal**: How would we know if this is working?
   > _______________

3. **Minimum bar**: What's the simplest version that tests the hypothesis?
   > _______________

---

## Conversation Test

Imagine explaining this to:

**A customer**: "This helps you _______________ so that _______________"
- [ ] Does this sound compelling?

**Leadership**: "We built this because _______________"
- [ ] Does this align with stated priorities?

**An investor**: "This moves the needle on _______________ metric"
- [ ] Is this connected to something we're tracking?

## Decision: Build or Skip?

| Signal | Yes | No |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Aligns with 12-24 month vision | | |
| Target persona would pay/engage | | |
| Passes product principles | | |
| Avoids anti-patterns | | |
| Has clear success metric | | |

**Recommendation**: 
- 5 Yes = Build now
- 3-4 Yes = Needs refinement
- <3 Yes = Revisit scope or skip

## Template: Prototype Brief

If proceeding, document:

```markdown
## Prototype: [Name]

**Date**: 
**Owner**: 

### Hypothesis
We believe [persona] will [behavior] if we [feature] because [insight].

### Aligned With
- Vision element: [which part of product vision]
- Leadership quote: "[direct quote supporting this]"
- Source: [meeting/conversation]

### Success Looks Like
[Measurable outcome]

### Minimum Scope
[Simplest version to test]

### Out of Scope
[What we're explicitly NOT building in v1]
