## Competitive Intelligence (Expanded from #competitors)

### Tier 1: Primary Competitors

#### Gong (25+ mentions - Dominant Competitor)
- **Win Rate Against**: Mixed - winning on automation, losing on established trust
- **Their Strengths**:
  - Native Salesforce integration (frequently cited)
  - Strong coaching and forecasting
  - Established platform trust ("hedge our bets on the established one")
- **Their Weaknesses** (customer-stated):
  - "Too expensive... overkill for what we need" (Kisi - $200/month)
  - "Gong is just a call recorder for us. And it's an expensive one" (Osano)
  - "It's very hard to get stuff back out of Gong" (Osano RevOps)
  - "Workflows are pretty shit, to be honest" (Customer quote)
  - Lacks automation: "They don't do the automation side of things" (AE quote)
  - No auto-CRM updates
- **AskElephant Positioning**: 
  - "I like the fact of how it evaluates call sentiment... But I think you guys do it better. But what I like the most is how after the call, it will evaluate what needs to happen and create tasks on its own" (Transax customer)
- **Key Accounts Evaluating**:
  - Tilt (Summer Safrit) - 2-month window before Gong sunset
  - AlignOps - Gong contract expiring
  - Yellowbrick Data - Using Clari Copilot, considering switch
  - Leland - Comparing Chorus vs AskElephant

#### Fathom (10+ mentions - Price Competitor)
- **Pattern**: Customers migrating TO AskElephant FROM Fathom
- **Their Strengths**:
  - Lower price point
  - Recap email with checkable action items
  - Consent-based recording with memory
  - Multilingual (German)
- **Their Weaknesses**:
  - Basic feature set
  - Limited automation
  - No deep CRM integration
- **Migration Signals**:
  - Kelly Taylor: Migrating ~1,000 calls from Fathom
  - Multiple customers using Fathom as baseline comparator
- **Customer Quote**: "We've had Fireflies. We have HubSpot. We use Fathom. We use them all. And we're like, hey. AskElephant's hands down the best one."

#### Momentum (3 mentions - Feature Competitor)
- **Critical Insight**: **Requires Salesforce** - blocker for HubSpot shops
- **Customer Quote**: "I would love to use Momentum. I think Momentum is great. You gotta be a Salesforce shop for Momentum to work." (Konnor Andersen)
- **Positioning Opportunity**: Clear HubSpot differentiation

#### Attention (3 mentions)
- **Pattern**: Used by PE firms across portfolio companies
- **Weakness**: Setup complexity
- **Quote**: "It took a long time to set up attention in a couple of businesses" (Vertica CP)
- **Opportunity**: Faster time-to-value positioning

### Tier 2: Secondary Competitors

#### Chorus/Chorus.ai (2 mentions)
- **Weakness**: "Brutal user experience"
- **Account**: Lumiq Learn - contract expires April, actively evaluating AskElephant
- **Quote**: "It's just it's a brutal brutal user experience."

#### Avoma (2 mentions)
- **Pattern**: Similar automation positioning
- **Account**: TopLeft - $200+/month for 2 users, evaluating switch
- **Positioning**: Cost savings + better automation

#### Granola (2 mentions)
- **Strength**: Calendar-based automatic recording
- **Weakness**: No HubSpot integration

### Tier 3: Emerging/Niche Competitors

| Competitor | Mentions | Key Signal |
|------------|----------|------------|
| **Clari Copilot** | 1 | No auto-CRM updates |
| **Triple Session** | 1 | Cotermed with Aircall, competitive on sales |
| **Spiky** | 1 | Adoption issues, Salesforce field failures |
| **Sybil** | 1 | Hallucination issues |
| **Circleback** | 1 | n8n integration (lost Blumo to this) |
| **Motion** | 1 | Calendar + Salesforce meeting prep |
| **Aida** | 1 | AI Chief of Staff positioning |
| **Luster** | 1 | Predictive Enablement positioning |

### Competitive Win/Loss Patterns

**We WIN when:**

2. HubSpot is CRM (Momentum ruled out)
3. Customer frustrated with manual CRM updates
4. Customer sees Gong as expensive/overkill
5. Customer needs post-sales (CS/expansion) features

**We LOSE when:**
1. Customer prioritizes established platform trust (Gong)
2. Native Salesforce integration is critical
3. Customer only needs basic transcription (Fathom cheaper)
4. Integration ecosystem is priority (n8n with Circleback)

### Competitive Battle Cards Needed
- [ ] Gong vs AskElephant (automation focus)
- [ ] Fathom vs AskElephant (feature parity + price)
- [ ] Momentum vs AskElephant (HubSpot advantage)
- [ ] Chorus vs AskElephant (UX + automation)

## CSM Operational Signals (from #team-csm)

### Onboarding Gaps Identified

1. **Workflow Versioning Education**
   - **Issue**: Customers don't understand workflows don't re-run when edited
   - **Quote**: "An onboarding gap I've been seeing more recently is a note about how workflows will not re-run when you make changes... It will make the calls I hop on with customers way more productive if they already have seen the builder at least briefly."
   - **Recommendation**: Add workflow versioning to onboarding deck

2. **Billing Transparency**
   - **Issue**: Customers surprised by prorated charges when adding users
   - **Quote**: "Please make sure that during onboarding, or during your calls with your customers, they understand they'll be billed when they add users."
   - **Root Cause**: Admins and billing contacts are different people

3. **Desktop/Mobile App Adoption**
   - **Issue**: Not enough customers using desktop and mobile apps
   - **Quote**: "Please make sure our customers are knowledgeable of, and setting up the desktop app and mobile app. Walk them through it and how to use."

### Expansion Program Launch
- **New Initiative**: 3 customers/month for intensive workflow focus
- **Quote**: "Every month I would like to identify three customers who could really benefit from very regular meetings where we really focus on outcomes that can help them expand."
- **Owner**: Solutions team

### CSM Shoutouts
- Ty (U08GHTYTWVC) handling Gong comparison call with Parker's support
- Eduardo (U07TKK5JH5G) getting customer praise: "Eduardo seems to be the baller because he's just getting shit done"

## Hypothesis Candidates

1. **1-seat customers without proactive engagement churn within 6 months**

2. **Native CRM integration reduces competitive churn by 50%+**
   - Evidence: Mobly cites Gong's native Salesforce as preference; multiple Gong comparisons
   - Strength: HIGH

3. **Settings hierarchy confusion causes recording failures**
   - Evidence: Rebuy user/manager conflict
   - Strength: MEDIUM

4. **HubSpot-first positioning wins deals against Momentum**
   - Evidence: "You gotta be a Salesforce shop for Momentum to work"
   - Strength: HIGH - clear differentiation opportunity

5. **Automation differentiation beats Gong on value**
   - Evidence: "Gong workflows are pretty shit"; "They don't do the automation side"
   - Strength: HIGH - resonating in sales calls

6. **Workflow versioning education reduces support tickets**
   - Evidence: CSM team identifying as onboarding gap
   - Strength: MEDIUM

7. **Desktop/mobile app adoption correlates with retention**
