# Figma Make: Composio Chat Interface Prototype Spec

**Signal Type:** Design Artifact  
**Source:** Adam (via Figma Make)  
**Captured:** 2026-01-22  
**Initiative:** composio-agent-framework  
**Variant:** Options A, B, C - Interactive Chat Interface  

---

## Context

This design spec was generated by Figma Make based on Adam's prototype exploration. It represents a vision for the **chat interface** within the Composio Agent Framework—specifically how users interact with agents via natural language.

This informs **Phase 2** of the design brief: the user-facing agent interaction experience.

---

## Design Specification

### Task
Build a React + Tailwind CSS interactive chat interface with a sequential message generation engine.

### Layout
- **Container:** Single centered column with strict 500px maximum width
- **Background:** Minimalist white background
- **Header:** Simple row at top containing icon (placeholder elephant/bot) and title "AskElephant" in bold

### Sticky Footer Input
A floating input card fixed to the bottom of the viewport:

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Container | White background, rounded corners, subtle drop shadow, generous padding |
| Textarea | Auto-expanding, dark grey text (`text-neutral-900`), lighter grey placeholder |
| Button | "Ask" button positioned absolutely in bottom-right of input card |
| Sub-text | Small, centered "Secure connection" label with shield icon below input card |

### Interaction & Animation Logic (Critical)

**Sequential Flow:** The interface must simulate a live AI thinking and generating process.

1. **Thinking State:** When request is made, show brief "thinking" indicator
2. **Streaming Text:** AI response appears character-by-character (typewriter effect)
3. **Artifact Chains:** UI artifacts (cards, lists, workflow suggestions) only appear AFTER preceding text block has completely finished typing

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Use `onAnimationEnd` callbacks (NOT timeouts) to trigger fade-in of subsequent elements
- This ensures perfect timing and prevents race conditions
- Create a `FadeInWrapper` component that handles opacity transition for artifacts

### Content Strategy

**Generic/Placeholder Only** — Do not use specific HubSpot or business logic text.

**Message Structure:**
1. **Message 1:** Generic greeting and confirmation of ability  
   _Example: "I can help you with that task. Here are some generated examples based on your criteria..."_

2. **Message 2:** List of generic "Suggested Workflows" or items that fade in after Message 1 completes

**Input Placeholder:** `"Describe your workflow..."`

## Design Implications for Composio

### What This Informs

| Design Brief Section | How This Applies |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Natural Language Instructions | Large comfortable textarea pattern |
| Agent Opt-in UX | Sequential reveal builds trust—show thinking, then result |
| Activity Log | Character-by-character streaming for real-time feel |
| Empty State | Clean, minimal starting point |

### Open Questions

1. **Does this pattern apply to the workflow builder node, or only standalone chat?**
2. **Should "Suggested Workflows" artifacts map to actual Composio integrations?**
3. **How does the "Secure connection" message relate to OAuth/service account flows?**
4. **Should the typewriter effect be configurable (speed, disable)?**

---

## Accessibility Notes

From the spec:
- Text contrast: Dark grey on white for input text
- Placeholder contrast: Lighter grey (should still meet WCAG AA)
- Animation: Consider `prefers-reduced-motion` for typewriter effect

---

## Next Steps

1. Review with Woody during Phase 2 UX exploration
2. Determine if this pattern extends to the Universal Agent Node configuration
3. Build prototype variant using this spec as foundation
4. Test animation timing with actual content lengths

## Raw Prompt (Preserved for Reference)

```
Task: Build a React + Tailwind CSS interactive chat interface with a sequential message generation engine.

Design Specs:

Layout: Single centered column with a strict 500px maximum width. Minimalist white background.
Header: Simple row at the top containing an icon (use a placeholder elephant or generic bot icon) and the title "AskElephant" in bold.
Sticky Footer Input: A floating input card fixed to the bottom of the viewport.
Style: White background, rounded corners, subtle drop shadow, plenty of internal padding.
Textarea: Auto-expanding text area. Input text must be Dark Grey (text-neutral-900) to contrast clearly with the Lighter Grey placeholder text.
Button: An "Ask" button positioned absolutely in the bottom-right of the input card.
Sub-text: A small, centered "Secure connection" label with a shield icon located below the input card.
Interaction & Animation Logic (Crucial):

Sequential Flow: The interface must simulate a live AI thinking and generating process.
Thinking State: When a request is made, show a brief "thinking" state.
Streaming Text: The AI response text must appear character-by-character (typewriter effect).
Artifact Chains: UI artifacts (like cards, lists, or workflow suggestions) must only appear after the preceding text block has completely finished typing.
Implementation Detail: Use onAnimationEnd callbacks (not timeouts) to trigger the fade-in of subsequent elements to ensure perfect timing and prevent race conditions.
FadeInWrapper: Create a wrapper component that handles the opacity transition for these artifacts.
Content Strategy:

Generic/Placeholder Only: Do not use specific HubSpot or business logic text.
Structure:
Message 1: A generic greeting and confirmation of ability (e.g., "I can help you with that task. Here are some generated examples based on your criteria...").
Message 2: A list of generic "Suggested Workflows" or items that fade in after Message 1 completes.
Input Placeholder: "Describe your workflow..."
```
