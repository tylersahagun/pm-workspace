## TL;DR

Tyler and Sam align on the need to simplify how work is prioritized and communicated. Current intake is fragmented across Pylon, Slack, meetings, Notion, and word-of-mouth; the only reliable system of record is merged PRs. Sam suggests shifting from fine-grained triage to quarterly “boulders,” with a focused stream on simplifying the meeting summary experience (reduce workflow complexity, voice-based prompt editing, meeting-type detection) and smaller parallel streams (admin/sign-up, backend cleanup). They explore ROI-driven prioritization using recent requests (Grain import, fine-grained access/privacy) and agree to capture ROI in a shared Notion doc. Strategic questions remain around mid-market focus, privacy/security table stakes, and the flagship experience AskElephant can lead with.

## Key Decisions

1. **Use larger “boulders” vs. fine-grained triage** to avoid scattered execution and improve roadmap clarity.
2. **Prioritize a flagship meeting summary experience**: simplify outputs, reduce workflow friction, and make customization voice-first.
3. **Maintain multiple work streams** rather than 100% focus on a single effort (core experience + admin/onboarding + backend cleanup).
4. **Apply ROI framing to ad hoc requests** (e.g., import integrations) to avoid derailment by low-return deals.
5. **Capture ROI examples in a shared Notion doc** for ongoing prioritization calibration.

## Problems Extracted

### Intake and Prioritization Gaps

> "The only true source of truth right now is GitHub PRs that have been merged."
> — Tyler

> "It feels like every day... it is not like we have this focus of this quarter."
> — Tyler

> "The triage would become pretty difficult... it's almost too fine grained."
> — Sam

### Product Experience Complexity

> "A workflow an average user doesn't wanna deal with... it's too complicated."
> — Sam

> "Right now, we're just generating coaching calls for everything."
> — Sam

> "Here's 47 workflow outputs and chats that you will never look at."
> — Tyler

### Execution Spread/Thrash

> "We are going so slow on seven, eight different paths."
> — Tyler

> "I imagine there's a lot of distractions and thrash too."
> — Sam

## Feature Requests / Concepts

1. **Voice-based prompt editing** for meeting summaries (no workflow clicks).
2. **Meeting type detection** to tailor summary outputs.
3. **Simplified summary + coaching flow** (single primary output with personalization).
4. **Chief-of-Staff bundle**: summary, follow-up emails, prep, daily brief.
5. **CRM automation agent** (post-manual update scaffold).
6. **Fine-grained access control** for privacy/visibility (table stakes for mid-market).
7. **Import integrations** (e.g., Grain) evaluated via ROI thresholds.

## Personas Mentioned

- **Sales Rep** (PLG entry, “AI-native” selling)
- **CSM** (workflow simplicity, follow-up execution)
- **Sales Leader** (coaching signal quality)
- **RevOps** (privacy/security and data controls for larger accounts)

---

## Strategic Alignment Assessment

### ✅ Aligned with Vision

- **Trust and simplicity**: reducing workflow complexity and focusing on a single flagship experience aligns with “quality over velocity.”
- **Human-centered AI**: voice-driven customization removes busywork while keeping user agency.

### ⚠️ Risks / Gaps

- **Outcome chain still fuzzy** for “chief of staff agent” without explicit success metrics.
- **Privacy/security scope** requires clearer evidence linkage to revenue outcomes (mid-market vs. SMB strategy).

---

## Hypothesis Matches

### Existing

- None explicitly referenced.

### Hypothesis Candidates

- **workflow-simplification-improves-adoption**: Reducing workflow complexity increases daily usage and retention.
- **meeting-summary-flagship-drives-growth**: A single standout experience improves PLG conversion and marketing clarity.
- **privacy-table-stakes-mid-market**: Fine-grained access control is a prerequisite for >40 seat deals.

---

## Follow-up Signals Needed

- Evidence volume for **privacy/security** pain across customers and pipeline.
- Customer demand frequency for **import integrations** (e.g., Grain).
- Clarity on **Q1 boulders** and ownership per stream.
