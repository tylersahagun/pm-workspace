[0:00:02] Founders (1557: Wanna make sure you don't have to keep on trying to find it, so it'll actually just tie that in. That's cool.

[0:00:06] Founders (1557: Yeah. It did spill the beans about, uh, the new deal thing that Brian built out that's not released. Fantastic. And what we're actually trying to do here guys go.

[0:00:17] Founders (1557: Thanks, sir. So I'm just hope for

[0:00:19] Founders (1557: a join the course. That's out of the. I'll get you here. So so Brian, Palmer, Tyler, and

[0:00:30] Founders (1557: Brian

[0:00:33] Founders (1557: runs the show. Actually, Sam is the new guy running the show, really. He's our head of product again.

[0:00:37] Founders (1557: Oh, okay. So Brian runs all

[0:00:39] Founders (1557: of The live demo. The most

[0:00:42] Founders (1557: Yeah. Different different teams. Brian is head of engineers. Sam is our product. Sam is fantastic.

[0:00:49] Founders (1557: He's like a survey. He's a wizard guy living. Owner built all the things. That's why I should That's start design. Wizard, uh, Sky, the wall screen here.

[0:01:00] Founders (1557: I was Okay. At 500,000,000 half for the last couple of. It is it's what's happening there.

[0:01:08] Founders (1557: I love it.

[0:01:10] Founders (1557: Fair enough. Accurate. What I miss? Cool. Crispy is better than me and everything in HubSpot, and at least it's good at me and everything in AskElephant.

[0:01:20] Founders (1557: So not super hard. Not super hard. I have an ego, so I don't say that lightly. Yeah. The goal of today, tell me if you guys disagree, is for all of you to have all your wildest dreams of questions you wanna ask and get flushed out and vetted, uh, asked.

[0:01:38] Founders (1557: And if Chris, disagree with that, might want you to be the same way if I ask the screen.

[0:01:45] Founders (1557: Hold on.

[0:01:46] Founders (1557: Deal. I was catching up on all the things and updates we've had, but one thing I haven't shown you yet is the global chat and the new, uh, mentioned we have. I don't know. Think you

[0:01:56] Founders (1557: wanna wrap that up, and then we'll

[0:01:57] Founders (1557: be on to all other stuff. So I'm gonna

[0:01:58] Founders (1557: introduce, please. But first, yeah, give a little introduction. Just wanna give

[0:02:03] Founders (1557: you some

[0:02:03] Founders (1557: context for what your background is for your time. Oh, yeah. I can tell. So I totally go to Aura Ring. Others places like that, social market operators, kind of my sole set.

[0:02:30] Founders (1557: So now I'm doing it inside of ZIMCO. I'm trying to build this out as a service, building out AI specifically as a service, leveraging AskElephant.

[0:02:37] Founders (1557: So Fantastic.

[0:02:43] Founders (1557: And this got to a place where we can show. So this is just chat. So tell them to say that this our leads so global search, I can treat our chat. Like, you have the access to everything with everything. And then if it doesn't actually connect, then integration's total.

[0:02:56] Founders (1557: I can literally just go and

[0:02:57] Founders (1557: connect from here with a click

[0:02:58] Founders (1557: of a button. It'll take a little bit of check. I can log in, and now I'll be able to access whatever. But I can push something to Gamma for me. Are you already connected?

[0:03:11] Founders (1557: Like, you can go and create a PowerPoint in Gamma just like the one I sent for you yesterday. Yeah. And all that, you know, and workflows.

[0:03:20] Founders (1557: I will.

[0:03:24] Founders (1557: This stuff will have workflows later on. And team are gonna have, like, specific notes that are more useful and more requested. Yeah. Whatever the workflows later, quite sooner, assuming a couple months, not tomorrow. Yeah.

[0:03:37] Founders (1557: I think that's all the updates now. Am missing anything?

[0:03:42] Founders (1557: You know, a little bit off the

[0:03:43] Founders (1557: end, but I think about that HubSpot agent stuff.

[0:03:46] Founders (1557: Oh, HubSpot testing, you can now instead of having to update a record in HubSpot. You can just update the test here and select a deal. That's huge.

[0:03:56] Founders (1557: Oh, no. It might be some. Brand new.

[0:03:59] Founders (1557: Did you also show that in, like, global checking, also find conversations where things are happening? Yep. Add content. K.

[0:04:07] Founders (1557: Didn't show that, but, yes, can do all that. Let's go.

[0:04:09] Founders (1557: Okay. Global check can be pulled up from any page. So if you're on a meeting page and you're like, I know that I talked about this driven client or I may find it similar to this, who might be similar, how we wanna approach this deal. You can query a global chat, either tag with people, and it'll pull in that context to either navigate you to those pages or be able to use

[0:04:29] Founders (1557: it side by side.

[0:04:30] Founders (1557: Oh, and is here. He's the one who's helping our creative AI. Alright. That's enough for me. I'm gonna shut up now

[0:04:40] Founders (1557: because I'm not as useful for

[0:04:41] Founders (1557: the rest of meeting. I'll let whoever, Brian, Sam, whatever you guys wanna focus on first.

[0:04:49] Founders (1557: Mean, do you have some good friends? I'll put in. Folder.

[0:04:58] Founders (1557: You guys you want all of us to do, that'll be changed. Oh, let me go into platform and go and put some stuff that I was building then.

[0:05:14] Founders (1557: Oh, actually, thought it was, yes. Work on workflows, you can't edit the

[0:05:18] Founders (1557: name unless you go to

[0:05:19] Founders (1557: the three dots and add a workflow details. Chris, we

[0:05:22] Founders (1557: have some house noise. But Yeah. Whatever. That's a that'll be too. I think what'd be cool is there's a lot of other systems that potentially get integrated.

[0:05:32] Founders (1557: So you've got HubSpot. You've got Gamma and other systems like that. I think most users, if you're gonna if you don't connect to an admin to the platform, they're expecting some sort of a leadership section to see what's connected, what's not connected. They're much like how, like, HubSpot does it where you can see the the the data sources that are I think it's pushed into or made from. Be cool.

[0:05:53] Founders (1557: I guess, I was able last night, I wasn't sure what is already connected, what's not connected for specific customers. And if I'm going to create a problem, see, scratching, that helps me yeah. So I've seen this, and the thing that I got a little later deeper to understand through the last, like, sync update. Like, uh, I think that already too last night, there's an API out of HubSpot. It takes, like, twenty minutes to rest if I created that improper and push, like, stuff into.

[0:06:19] Founders (1557: And having, like, a resync button would be awesome. Mhmm. But I was testing a Really,

[0:06:24] Founders (1557: it took twenty minutes. You created a new property,

[0:06:26] Founders (1557: tried to push something in there. It was five new properties on a single, what, deal, and I was pushing just a prompt that was extracting the information and then linking to the properties. And it was I kept testing. Was like, fail fail fail. Was like, yeah.

[0:06:40] Founders (1557: It takes twenty minutes for the API to to rest finish or stuff to date. So K. That'd be cool. Send it recommended either wait twenty minutes or, like, disconnect the the sand and then reconnect it. I'm also gonna wanna do that.

[0:06:54] Founders (1557: So, yeah, just wait twenty minutes.

[0:06:58] Founders (1557: I'd love to know a little bit more about, like, why what? So when you were at using AskElephant mhmm. Okay. So I worked with James. There's good.

[0:07:07] Founders (1557: James was my boss at the time when I was working with, actually. And, um, so moving into your current role, like, why what what about AskElephant made you say, hey. We should actually start AskElephant here, like, making you wanna refer it. What is the value that you see, not as such as what we could say that you actually you're are driving people to try to sell outside of. You've heard of bullet notes.

[0:07:29] Founders (1557: We can update your CRM. Like, because there's a lot of platforms that do both of those things. So what about the cloud? I think, know, this is more powerful. We could do with it.

[0:07:38] Founders (1557: Yeah. I think that

[0:07:43] Founders (1557: that's where I think you have competitive advantage over other companies such Fathom because Fathom gives a demo added about their login. We can now log to CRM properties, it's still not live for their right now. And something as simple as I can be hands off keyboard and conduct the sale and the actions I'm supposed to take as a rep still happen. That's very powerful for sales teams because what you're removing from that is the friction that a sales rep has being processed. I don't wanna input my data.

[0:08:15] Founders (1557: I don't wanna use HubSpot playbooks. Like, you you you've literally solved you've showed off playbooks.

[0:08:20] Founders (1557: Probably a time ago. I'm not familiar with playbooks actually.

[0:08:22] Founders (1557: So HubSpot playbook is a modified structured note in HubSpot where you can have, like, in a a field that has a title, which is do they have a budget? And you fill in whatever the budget is,

[0:08:33] Founders (1557: and then you go to

[0:08:34] Founders (1557: the next one, you fill it in and you log in as an activity.

[0:08:36] Founders (1557: So it's a form. It's a glorified form. Exactly.

[0:08:38] Founders (1557: Yeah. And so most sales teams that use HubSpot use playbooks or notes or something like that. Now it's like this is why I like the idea of I

[0:08:46] Founders (1557: don't know. For our instance or our reviews.

[0:08:50] Founders (1557: So, Christy, would it be before it's I'm on

[0:08:53] Founders (1557: a call, I'm looking at my playbook.

[0:08:55] Founders (1557: Tell me what, like, what are

[0:08:56] Founders (1557: what are some concerns that

[0:08:57] Founders (1557: you have? And I'm, filling out my objection section. It's like, okay. That's fantastic. And so you say, well, I'm really concerned about the budget, so I go to my budget session.

[0:09:04] Founders (1557: Like, okay. Well, we offer this, this, and this, and it's filling it up with the same kind of status. Exactly. True discovery where it's Exactly. You know, tell

[0:09:10] Founders (1557: me more about yourself.

[0:09:11] Founders (1557: Like, where you're actually coming from? What are your expectations? Like, what are those pain what's your feelings? And then after the call, I can have to trust that my CRM is gonna be updated not only with what your your boss wants, what the head of everybody wants, all these things, but also the notes that you would need in order to make that sale. I'll read that to you.

[0:09:28] Founders (1557: Yeah.

[0:09:29] Founders (1557: It provides a better sales experience externally for the customer because it means that I'm not listening to you and then taking all my notes down. And then after the next question, do I take all my notes down? Like, as dumb as that sound, it's it's really a core difference between those that are really good sellers and those that are using Playbooks and stuff like that. And then the set of the pieces from an internal standpoint, you are covering your basis in the sense of if I ever have to hand off this deal, all the context is there. Not because of the HubSpot data that I inputted, but because it's already logged and I can have my deal insights and my logistics and all that other stuff because of the record, which is great for sales teams that have, like, the e r a e model or even, like, a sales to service model.

[0:10:09] Founders (1557: That stuff's very powerful because Playbook's the number one usage is a handoff between reps and HubSpot and up to the teams and HubSpot.

[0:10:19] Founders (1557: So at least I'll be monopolizing this.

[0:10:21] Founders (1557: So Exactly.

[0:10:22] Founders (1557: I've got a a lot of things. So one one thing that we're missing right now in AskElephant that we're trying to screen. I'm I'm not how much. Yeah.

[0:10:35] Founders (1557: Also, what about Tyler and I have the same shirt from Costco?

[0:10:38] Founders (1557: Yeah. It was pretty I got it last night. James texted me. He's like, hang on. Really wanna fax you.

[0:10:42] Founders (1557: That's not, like, a

[0:10:43] Founders (1557: cute idea. Let's take that. So went to Costco. No. So one thing that we're missing on the site right now is is, like, as as a rep so I at one point, I had a little bit of business here with a CSM.

[0:10:57] Founders (1557: So now if I'm if I'm in AskElephant, and I want to know what what calls I should what customers I should be concerned about or what deals I could be closing, we don't actually have, like, a dedicated place for that. So I have a company's view. I have a contacts view, but nothing that actually says this is what well, this is what's what's going on. So that that's one place that we're trying to make, um, some strides. One one thing that we can do, though, is say, like, hey.

[0:11:25] Founders (1557: I wanna see what type of or which customers I've been working with might be able to expand and add scenes, voice based focus matters. So there's Can you repeat that chat on

[0:11:37] Founders (1557: the side? I've never seen that before.

[0:11:39] Founders (1557: So this is global chat. Um, we've we've talked to each about it, and he's he's getting up. He's a little bit I have

[0:11:44] Founders (1557: to go to the chats on my left.

[0:11:45] Founders (1557: If if you hit, uh, command k on your keyboard or control k, it'll pull up this global chat window. And when you pull up the window, if you do an at sign, then this is where I can look up Grisby. And now I can add your name to contacts and say, like, Chris b hasn't had a bunch of calls with AskElephant with James, and I wanna know exactly why AskElephant is the best tool for him and how it's gonna help him make the $7,000,000,000 for the next seven years or something like

[0:12:19] Founders (1557: that.

[0:12:21] Founders (1557: So this helps a little bit with that process of asking it, but I'm, one, trying to emphasize that that pain point of, like, what what we know we have. How much is that actually relevant to you in your role? Like, I don't actually have a place to work here, or is it just I can configure my workflows. I don't even have to work at AskElephant. It is hands off.

[0:12:39] Founders (1557: At the end of the day, I can have to pull back to that so I'm not sure if

[0:12:42] Founders (1557: it's updated. Yeah. I think this is where you're gonna if you're getting the realm of the future state of the CRM, you're into the the objection of, well, HubSpot already does this for me. Why is this better? Because for me, when I see that is I use AskElephant for contextual delivery of information that I don't have to manually plug in, and then I can format it rather where I want to.

[0:13:04] Founders (1557: But for stuff like that, like, if I need to go see my customers, that's how it builds my CRM for me. And AskElephant is just enriching the data with the context and behavior and scoring or whatever it is that I'm that I'm doing with a prompt. So I don't feel the need to go and look at my customers in AskElephant because my ideal state is AskElephant is the delivery aspect, and I'm doing my actions inside of HubSpot. For CRM, usually, we're a sales rep. Like, CRM is the center of my universe.

[0:13:33] Founders (1557: Like, my deals in the place where I make money, that's center of my universe. Did I answer your question?

[0:13:38] Founders (1557: Yeah. It does. What about on the ops side? So, like, it it is the handoff. So you can get handed a deal, a sales rep

[0:13:45] Founders (1557: at least who said, hey. This is 20 k deal.

[0:13:48] Founders (1557: I want you to close. Then you go to HubSpot and you're looking through, or does it make sense to you to use AskElephant and and ask those questions of, like, what were

[0:13:55] Founders (1557: they actually concerned about? Where where does it go? If I'm a good rep, my manager forces that process, then, like, yes. I'll do it. Normally, what ends up happening with handoff is the rep lightly glances at notes or there's some handoff document that's not really useful, and then I go, I'm just gonna redo the sale process from scratch.

[0:14:11] Founders (1557: That's normally how it happens, honestly, in, B2B sale environments. But this is where, like, you you replace the situation. I'm talking to James about this earlier where but the way that I've seen the easiest way that I've seen to sell this from from my standpoint is it's not AI and systems are not a replacement for people. It's a replacement for situations that your current people are running into Yeah. Which is stuff like that, which is myself, if they're picking up deals from someone else, and they have to look at this big document with all the context, they're not going to throw up the information, like, period.

[0:14:44] Founders (1557: But what's great about what AskElephant can do instead is, like, the overview, the middle pane of the deal record already has the information of the logistics and the diagnostics and the forecasting piece and whatnot, which is much better because it's just a little thing of points here and there that give me the exact thing that I need.

[0:15:00] Founders (1557: How how how would we if I can ask this question? If AskElephant were to build out something that, like, interface with deal objects or other kind of objects and custom properties Yeah. And then you just save properties. You must go into HubSpot. At some point, I think the goal that we should disagree is to make so it's like, hey.

[0:15:19] Founders (1557: Everything you have in HubSpot is already in AskElephant, and it's AI powered. I mean, we a better workplace. Why don't you just cancel HubSpot? Like, if that was the play, how how will and what obstacles do you think that will have with a lot of folks?

[0:15:37] Founders (1557: I think that it'll be hard to get to that point because businesses are now going all, like, on HubSpot for their entire another entire tech stack, 50 to 60% plus of their tech stack because it has the marketing engine and the sales engine, the service engine, and the operational engine all at one platform. So if so if you're able to replace HubSpot entirely, you have to become full suite, which is an enormous project. Like, that's enormous. You're you're you're building dozens of bugs at that point, not one single large CRM system. So it's big because you're not just replacing the CRM aspect.

[0:16:19] Founders (1557: You are becoming the full rev ops and marketing automation platform and service and engineering, like, sequencing tool all in one. So if you're to do that, great. But you're entering, like, a small pond of a lot of sharks. That one. Palomable?

[0:16:37] Founders (1557: Yes. Possible. It's a lot. My admin I have another phone on this. What you mentioned, Tyler, my usage for me just showed

[0:16:51] Founders (1557: in terms of Google Chat.

[0:16:52] Founders (1557: If you had do you have HubSpot's Huddl in in

[0:16:56] Founders (1557: in your browser? I will give them

[0:16:57] Founders (1557: Yeah.

[0:16:57] Founders (1557: I think

[0:16:58] Founders (1557: it's a deal record. My use in show this here's what I would would love.

[0:17:03] Founders (1557: I don't

[0:17:04] Founders (1557: know if this exists already. It's possible that I just don't know. I would love a global chat to be a card or a on the record sidebar in HubSpot directly. I would use the fuck out of that. Like, say that one more time.

[0:17:18] Founders (1557: You said I I would use Oh, the the global chat. Yeah. The the global chat. If it was embedded in HubSpot directly, I don't know if which one you do, like, a custom React card. You can do the an iframe if you wanted to.

[0:17:31] Founders (1557: But if you had it embedded on the sidebar, like, a good example is do the Gamma, the extension on the Jotrigger. Yeah. Go to the same deal. The Breeze

[0:17:42] Founders (1557: agent is gonna be the

[0:17:43] Founders (1557: closest one. Yeah. Breeze agent

[0:17:44] Founders (1557: is probably the closest name

[0:17:45] Founders (1557: for this. Some of our reps.

[0:17:47] Founders (1557: We even have, like, happily as an example, how it was trashed, but Breeze record summary.

[0:17:51] Founders (1557: Got it.

[0:17:51] Founders (1557: And you got

[0:17:52] Founders (1557: it there.

[0:17:53] Founders (1557: That exact thing where I could use that inside of my deal record. Like, the idea of the rep or not not the idea. The end state of what a rep wants to do is I don't want to have to lead the current system that I'm in to do the action that I wanna take. And the beauty of this is, like, deals are where I make money. That's where I wanna spend all my time.

[0:18:09] Founders (1557: Right? And if I wanted in context to to increase the velocity of my deal, I don't wanna have to leave the current platform I'm in. So having AskElephant as a sub bar here would be incredible,

[0:18:21] Founders (1557: incredible. Piece that I think isn't necessary for that within the context window of that little chat needs to be all the contacts' calls that so the contact is associated with this deal. Any call that's them that's in AskElephant should be in the context window or at least searchable within things very easily.

[0:18:39] Founders (1557: It's actually one of the most common things that I've heard from HubSpot partners. I was on a call with, um, someone from about Brandon. Yeah. Brandon from two weeks ago, and he's brought it up multiple times. He's like, I'll build it.

[0:18:51] Founders (1557: Well, he's a software engineer there. He's like, I like having an extension of loading anything that would be so helpful. So part of it is that this is where you're used to getting work done. Right? This is where reps, the people that aren't actually configuring workflows, they're they're not just trying to be there.

[0:19:10] Founders (1557: It's back to back calls from 8AM until they meet at six. Yeah. They're trying to make sure they're always in context. Having an inputs that are already working is just that they can get that how I'm searching between tabs. Mhmm.

[0:19:22] Founders (1557: It gives them the context where

[0:19:23] Founders (1557: they want to be.

[0:19:24] Founders (1557: Exactly. Yeah. I mean, that that having that I would say not just on deals, but on all objects would be extremely powerful, like, extremely powerful. Because then you I think this does a couple of things. One is it delivers the context that a rep with a user needs at any given time, and, also, I think it increases adoption of the platform because you're you're there.

[0:19:46] Founders (1557: You're everywhere at that point. You're in AskElephant

[0:19:48] Founders (1557: with your your your prompts,

[0:19:49] Founders (1557: and then you're also in HubSpot, and you're exposing the usage of it globally to business at that point. Because that sidebar lives everywhere for all CRM users even if they're not licensed to a AskElephant at that point. So,

[0:20:04] Founders (1557: Palmer, Brian, we've briefly talked about that piece too, like, having sidebar. I was just curious if you

[0:20:10] Founders (1557: guys had shoots around that too.

[0:20:14] Founders (1557: Not related to the value of a I'm from a technical perspective, I'm just curious, like, what I'm trying to think if you get up to her with for something like that. So, obviously, that's a direct HubSpot integration.

[0:20:23] Founders (1557: As long as global chat gets dialed in, it is fantastic. I would have no problem paying someone like Brandon or Chris if your team wants to do it. Like, I called the brand to go knock it out. Sounds like tell me if you disagree. I feel like it is adjacent to most of what you guys are focused on anyways from the dev side.

[0:20:41] Founders (1557: Do do you just need to go from HubSpot?

[0:20:43] Founders (1557: Yeah. Oh, on the scope space? Don't have to, like

[0:20:47] Founders (1557: Sort of log in? Yeah. Typically, direct integrations with other applications have a review process.

[0:20:53] Founders (1557: We have our voice, Chris, more to, like, make that not nearly as painful if we do it correctly. So and if Chris is working as a manager, Justin Gracie excuse me.

[0:21:04] Founders (1557: Yeah. That's he. Is Justin Gracie the head Yeah. You know?

[0:21:09] Founders (1557: He's And also now paying for

[0:21:11] Founders (1557: his wife. Yeah. He's a. And then Yeah. He's not done it.

[0:21:15] Founders (1557: Well, that's awesome. I'm sorry. Want to change accomplish. Counsel, but I have not done it, but he was three anyway. Middle there thinking about it already.

[0:21:23] Founders (1557: That's good. You're telling me. Interesting.

[0:21:29] Founders (1557: So have have you set this up for your for your companies? Like, the audition piece or How how's that experience been? So we've been trying to make a lot of different changes, like, for workflows inside of AskElephant. Should be slightly testing is one thing that we're aware. It's it it's honestly hard to see what's actually been updated or, yeah, that we're aware of.

[0:21:51] Founders (1557: Palmer has made some awesome changes to, you

[0:21:53] Founders (1557: know, like, the structure

[0:21:54] Founders (1557: of HubSpot. Other than that, I'm curious what some of your experiences. Is it incredibly painful to try to build stuff out, or is it like, you know what? This is actually manageable.

[0:22:04] Founders (1557: Yeah. I'll say this with a caveat of I'm probably more technically advanced than, like, your average person who goes to build this stuff because I think it didn't grow, like, once upon a time. One is currently as well. So I think it's easy to build things. The thing that I read into is the limitations of my own HubSpot instance, which is why I finally now understand why people couldn't value AskElephant because it's not so much AskElephant as their HubSpot can.

[0:22:38] Founders (1557: That's the thing that I think was the blocker of all

[0:22:40] Founders (1557: kind of sense. Yeah. Can I ask a follow-up to that? Yeah.

[0:22:44] Founders (1557: Please go for it.

[0:22:44] Founders (1557: But so when James first showed me Superd, I thought that Superd was one of the coolest HubSpot, big session companies that I'd ever seen because it's it's trying to solve that if I'm not Understood.

[0:22:56] Founders (1557: Where it's it's basically, like,

[0:22:59] Founders (1557: in its way, it's I wanna try to build this flow about a AskElephant. I can use super to install those properties like a package or plug in. Right? But instead, it's I just wanna augment that. I want those just to be done.

[0:23:10] Founders (1557: Yeah. The problem is with not the problem, but the the constraint we see with with customers or not that Superb was. Customers don't know what they want or need. They just know the pain in the experience, and there isn't a one size fits all package for sales teams even if you're BD SaaS. Yeah.

[0:23:30] Founders (1557: But it's not a one size fits all because you have different sales methodologies, different team sizes, stuff like that. So you can build a foundational model, but there's still nuances that apply toward each customer that make them unique, which means the success of AskElephant is limited based upon how good the CRM is in reality. But that's that's what I found with customers right now that once you use it is unless you're using HubSpot and you trust the data and your sales team believes in using deals, contacts, and companies, something as simple as that. Does your team use these three objects? I think I I believe fully dictate whether AskElephant will be successful with that team because most sales teams will only use deals, and they won't use contacts.

[0:24:12] Founders (1557: They won't use companies. They won't have other activities inside of

[0:24:15] Founders (1557: the the platform. Is that is that true? Like, common practice that they won't use they'll just use deals and not have contacts in companies also.

[0:24:24] Founders (1557: 90% of your time. Yeah. Like, literally generous. Like, probably more like Have

[0:24:28] Founders (1557: heard of before?

[0:24:29] Founders (1557: Yeah. Yeah. I was an insurance agent for a couple of years.

[0:24:32] Founders (1557: Yes. Sales reps from process are, like, imposing forces. Yeah. And sales reps just wanna do whatever they're rogue cowboys want to do whatever the LA. Make money.

[0:24:41] Founders (1557: Things like I was born so Yeah. I'm sorry. Conception. I

[0:24:50] Founders (1557: I might have missed conception. So when when a deal is created inside of HubSpot, it doesn't require there to be an associated company in contact. Like, you don't create a. A contact isn't on a deal, and they also have to be I and I just assumed HubSpot out

[0:25:04] Founders (1557: of the box does not require it. You have to manually turn that setting on to make that happen. So so this is yeah. So this is where, again, the thing that I ran into and this is I wanna say a good problem. It's a it's a nice problem for me because it means that I can fix your HubSpot instance for this is why I point James is so good at servicing customers.

[0:25:23] Founders (1557: You know how do the HubSpot piece. And you know, like, AskElephant piece where, like, some of the AI redo, uh, teams like that. The I would consider the primary need is HubSpot dev, but a big piece of what they need to be successful with AskElephant is HubSpot with

[0:25:38] Founders (1557: Like, that's exactly why we're looking, Christy, is because I don't want Whitaker or Eli or anybody else to be configuring HubSpot. They don't have the context and background. CRMs have to be done. Yes. Frankly, near perfectly in my opinion, actually.

[0:25:50] Founders (1557: Like, if you screw it up, like, it just makes people turn off HubSpot, actually. Yeah. And, anyways so, like, that's why

[0:25:57] Founders (1557: it would be crispy for those. So that's

[0:25:59] Founders (1557: why I'll give you a parallel constraint with what Subaru dealt with. So Subaru has got two bugs. You mentioned the package builder piece, which is we can box up HubSpot build and send them out. There's an end user platform, which is the ability to embed the process directly in HubSpot, which is, hey. Show me all deals that don't have a deal amount.

[0:26:17] Founders (1557: And press play, and it builds a list of all those deals. It shows you what to do. The problem super currently runs into now is that the constraint customer said or the the objection was, well, I don't have my process documented, so I can't use this platform. And then for like, I don't know what what my processes are or what I should be doing. Yeah.

[0:26:36] Founders (1557: So even though we can build, like, a best practice set of rules or whatever, there's always unique things and nuances that made them that go out of the box, whatever that foundational build was. So same kind of thing here, which is you're relying upon the quality of the CRM build and whether the team uses it, and there's gonna be nuances that the customer needs in order to be fully successful with using that bot following.

[0:26:59] Founders (1557: That's that's actually really helpful. I wanna

[0:27:01] Founders (1557: I wanna

[0:27:01] Founders (1557: try something with are you working with Redo or School AI? Oh. Oh. Is that right? K.

[0:27:07] Founders (1557: So I I was working with School AI. I went to an on-site with their CSM team. Do you mind if I understand you?

[0:27:14] Founders (1557: Yeah. Go ahead.

[0:27:15] Founders (1557: Something that AskElephant right now does that I think can help with this I'm just trying to to ideate a little bit. So if HubSpot is on, one thing you can do is say, I want you to see how our HubSpot is currently configured, whether or not we're using the right type of objects for companies, deals, contacts. And if I want to have, like, a world class experience inside of HubSpot, what might be missing or nothing to add?

[0:27:47] Founders (1557: Oh, so you should stop, I think, some point.

[0:27:49] Founders (1557: Just due vacation. It's it's

[0:27:51] Founders (1557: really helpful. So the the reason I started doing this is that I was helping James build out workflows for customers, and I don't I hadn't used HubSpot before. But the nice thing is that tools can help go through an audit. So when you're building workflows, a customer it's it's actually one

[0:28:07] Founders (1557: of those common things that

[0:28:08] Founders (1557: we get on the first call for implementation is, hey. The platform's really cool. Not only do

[0:28:14] Founders (1557: I not know what like, I don't

[0:28:15] Founders (1557: have my process documented. We don't have a process. It's we want to start using AI. We've kind of been doing Vance. We've kind of been doing, like, the SAMR methodology.

[0:28:24] Founders (1557: We've got our grid

[0:28:24] Founders (1557: model build technology. But how do we how do

[0:28:27] Founders (1557: we actually start implementing that? What where do we put that into our system? So, like, we've got HubSpot, but it's not true. So it would be this is what we'd like to happen. I'll work with that in HubSpot.

[0:28:38] Founders (1557: So then I'd ask the question, like, what properties am I should I fill out and then taking it to them? It's a very manual process. It has been in the past. Is this close to, like, what what it would be saying? Hey.

[0:28:49] Founders (1557: How well configured is the HubSpot configuration? Because you have, like, your master plan. I mean, we'll take it back to them and say, oh, this is what? I come back to you. So it says I'll hide these for a little more.

[0:29:04] Founders (1557: It's like, okay. It looks like you've got companies, contacts, deals, tickets, meetings. We're missing account health scoring. Here's some properties that you could add. Oh, sorry.

[0:29:16] Founders (1557: It's a is this close to

[0:29:20] Founders (1557: what you're talking about? Yeah. I know

[0:29:22] Founders (1557: this is a manual process.

[0:29:23] Founders (1557: But

[0:29:23] Founders (1557: Yeah. It it it is close. So the thing that I find is there's a layer deeper k. Here that, like, a provider kinda fills in, especially with school AIs.

[0:29:33] Founders (1557: This is

[0:29:33] Founders (1557: a really good example. Scroll to the the top of this output. It was the probability is mentioned.

[0:29:48] Founders (1557: Third stage probabilities. Yeah. Yeah. It's gonna

[0:29:50] Founders (1557: take probabilities that align the sales methodology. They don't use sales methodology. And I talked to them last week, And one of the things they I asked them was, hey. Do you guys have Medfix, Spice, whatever it is? Like, they they wanna do forecasting, and you can't really do good forecasting without knowing, hey.

[0:30:06] Founders (1557: Is the person qualified or not? And part of that is having a sales methodology run through. So even this, like, I think what it's pulling is the out of the box deal stage probabilities, which are often wrong for most businesses because people either have too many pipeline stages or too little or doesn't match the sales process. Yeah.

[0:30:22] Founders (1557: I would say, like, 90% of the

[0:30:24] Founders (1557: time, they're wrong. Yeah. Like, the the the I think this overestimates the intelligence of HubSpot users, which sounds really shitty, but a lot of a lot of sales reps, honestly, or people that use HubSpot just uses a repository to dump all their shit because they don't realize what the the the power of the platform is. This is where, like, it gets to a perfect example. No sales methodology, no probabilities per stage.

[0:30:46] Founders (1557: Hence why I'm talking to them this week to outline here we should be thinking about in terms of data points that you should use to qualify behavior, stuff like that. And so even though this says your probabilities are great, in reality, they're nonexistent. They're really what it is. So this is good for high level stuff, and there's nuances beneath it, which is the customer doesn't know what they doesn't know what they need. They know what the pay point is.

[0:31:10] Founders (1557: And for them, their constraint is I can't do forecasting because my data sucks. It's like, your data sucks. It's nonexistent, which is different. Like, it's a very different problem to solve. You know?

[0:31:21] Founders (1557: Like, if your data is that bad, that means we go fix HubSpot and clean up the data and go through, like, a rearchitecture of your build. Nonexistent data is probably an AskElephant to enrich the the properties of. Different solution, same, like, paint one for the customers, and then where you gotta select root cause of whatever they're trying to solve.

[0:31:38] Founders (1557: So is this would this be helpful to be able to say, I'm you know what? Actually because you are the expert, like you said. It's missing that layer deeper, but you can go through and select and say, actually, I wanna create these properties and have them tracked and say, create x number of properties. But also be able to audit yourself and say, okay. Is it actually missing this sales methodology?

[0:31:58] Founders (1557: Like, I want to remove the sales methodology. I actually wanna start, like, create a new field specifically for the probabilities related to that methodology or met big. And now you're gonna go on-site and say, hey. We're start using MEDDPIC or we're using SPICE. Now there's gonna be a field on whether or not they actually follow that process.

[0:32:20] Founders (1557: Mean, yes. The thing that I can also see with something like this is I hear a lot of customers say, I just want a best price hospital built. Like, I wanna do everyone's stupid. I hear that all the time. Nobody has

[0:32:32] Founders (1557: the same. Yeah.

[0:32:34] Founders (1557: Mean, everyone says that. You know what I mean? And in reality, that's not what they want at all. They wanna think and solve their problem and, like, gets them over the constraint they have. So this helps with establishing what the best practice would be, but oftentimes, I find that best practice is not what the what they actually want.

[0:32:53] Founders (1557: It's something that goes deeper, which is I want this to work for my sales team, my sales team. I mean, everyone says they're not or everyone says that they're my business is unique. My pipeline, my sales team has a unique sales process, which is somewhat true in terms of the data. But, generally, this can solve for the high level foundation, but there's still a level deeper, which is the nuances that need to be designed, which is, like I mean, another thing that caught my attention here was, you know, like, actual close date as a recommendation for property. Yeah.

[0:33:23] Founders (1557: Actual close date versus expected close date, uh, tracking for velocity. Here's what would happen if you build that in HubSpot. Yeah. Close date generally comes ready out of the box. You cannot remove that from the record view.

[0:33:34] Founders (1557: It stays there forever. So that means you're gonna have regular close date, uh, actual close date, and an expected close date of all those properties, which is so clear for everyone anytime before. Exactly. Yeah.

[0:33:45] Founders (1557: I was well, you know, I'll

[0:33:46] Founders (1557: just get all three of them. Whatever.

[0:33:47] Founders (1557: And so the only way I'd ever recommend having a second one is initial expected close date. Yeah.

[0:33:53] Founders (1557: And that would be in a

[0:33:53] Founders (1557: background field that nobody sees except for me in a report. Yeah.

[0:33:57] Founders (1557: So there's certain pieces of this that are good for high level stuff, but there's also, like, the layer deeper where I talked to Corey about this yesterday. It's really hard for us to hire sales reps, like, in our field because you have to be very consultative and strategic and think about stuff like this before you sell someone on something. Otherwise, it will fit. And, like, stuff like this is the exact reason why HubSpot accounts get set up a certain way. They don't get used by the customer, and they don't trust HubSpot.

[0:34:24] Founders (1557: They look for other systems to supplement whatever they need.

[0:34:30] Founders (1557: So I think I see, like, the for the app the HubSpot app and developer for the consultant that's

[0:34:40] Founders (1557: going to try to help for

[0:34:41] Founders (1557: the sales leader. Like, that the that persona is very clear on, like, how some of these processes can be improved. What would you change as a as a rep using AskElephant with HubSpot? Is it

[0:34:52] Founders (1557: really just I just want it to

[0:34:54] Founders (1557: be on my call and be as hands off as possible?

[0:34:56] Founders (1557: You know, how

[0:34:56] Founders (1557: much of it is also,

[0:34:57] Founders (1557: like, the discovery piece? I think it's I view it very much as I want AskElephant to be my sidekick everywhere that I go, which means that I wanna make a phone call, and I wanna execute everything for, like, transcribe, make sure I feel the, you know, prompts or the bits that I say, log in to HubSpot, honestly, send my recast. Boom. Like, that means I can power that. I can be a true power dialer at that point instead of having to call, send all my notes, do my recap, usually forget to do it and lose the deal.

[0:35:27] Founders (1557: You don't have all this stuff being automated and have that look at HubSpot for when I'm, you know, back on my desktop ready to start a big curve things, whatever it is. Just being with me everywhere that I go is very powerful. I think that experience will overlap. It depends on what you said before that, which is the HubSpot admin developer. Most companies do not have a dedicated HubSpot admin.

[0:35:48] Founders (1557: It's owned as a secondary job function by a marketing leader. It's usually what I see or sometimes a sales leader. So, usually, you gotta kinda solve for both in that scenario, which is how do I help you as a sales leader and also you're the HubSpot admins? You kinda have to be, like, both sides of it.

[0:36:11] Founders (1557: I think what would be helpful too is to help them understand how your your team's business model is integrating AskElephant into your workflows. And if you have, like, the as you're going to market with your team, how are you structuring AskElephant within it? Mhmm. And I think that's helpful because it's to me,

[0:36:32] Founders (1557: that's super cool. Right? Like, if we could have

[0:36:35] Founders (1557: a million Krispies running around there, you know, the level of that

[0:36:38] Founders (1557: would be awesome nowadays. I can show you. Gonna charge you. I can I can share screen on this? Right?

[0:36:43] Founders (1557: Yeah. Yeah. Also, I'll show you.

[0:36:46] Founders (1557: Just join the encounter events.

[0:37:01] Founders (1557: Actually, that one, but I think it will

[0:37:03] Founders (1557: fit better than this one. So I guess a big issue.

[0:37:14] Founders (1557: So when I was building this out, I was thinking about situations, uh, versus versus, like, education, I would say, in terms of, like, a sale process or the go to market strategy piece. The thing that I find and, like, super really dealt with this the most was we had to educate a lot on the sales process, and it resulted in people not understanding and us having to keep this that it is the right solution. That's not what you want. You want them to say, oh, wow. I should use this for an app.

[0:37:52] Founders (1557: That's really, like, the experience that I was trying to create with this. So Alright. Cool. So this is how we think about AI as a as a service right now. Alright.

[0:38:26] Founders (1557: So we really want to do full funnel type of service because most AI usage with companies right now is top of funnel. It's Clay. It's lead gen. It's how do I create a list that matches my ICP, which is a great use case. But, ultimately, you still are running the constraint of how do get my sales reps to capitalize on the great data that I have access to now.

[0:38:53] Founders (1557: So I'll fly through kinda, like, what this looks like. This is our fourth phase, like, approach when we're doing ASR service right now, which is, you know, the phase one of the definition of acquisition phase, which is let's fill out your ICP and figure out how we create more of those, how do we create the go to market strategy to target those specifically. We can use to extract the data, stuff like that. The thing we've we've already run into in this area is most companies do not know their customer, period. Because most companies just do.

[0:39:23] Founders (1557: And so this has a result of us building out, like, the ICP agent inside of AskElephant to figure out what are the things that we can find using CLI, using AskElephant to generate the ICP, and then use that for the hypothesized testing. So it's building a persona into a visual using the clay table to build more of them, you know, and following that into the CRM essentially is what it is. Oh, excuse me. That part. Phase two is essentially the conversion aspect, which is, okay.

[0:39:49] Founders (1557: Now that we have these personas, how do we convert them into deals and make sure that they're being treated properly, what messaging resonates with them, and how do we quantify the the value proposition aspect, whether it resonates with them accordingly and spit that out of the HubSpot reporting. Phase three is where this gets, like, really awesome because our head of use to ask my boyfriend platform. So the thing that we want to help the sales managers, CROs, directors, whoever owns revenue for the business is answer the questions that they have in their brain at a given time. It looks like it's really what it is. But most sales managers, most CROs have to dig for data, have to dig for context all the time.

[0:40:33] Founders (1557: It sucks. It's a really painful part of their job. So we want to embed that AI sales manager inside of the area where the reps work and the CRO, unfortunately.

[0:40:43] Founders (1557: Can I double tap on what that looks like? We'll get there. Yeah. The number of slots are received between 10PM and 8AM from CRO and sales manager saying, hey. What's the next step on this deal?

[0:40:53] Founders (1557: I don't see this on this deal. Hey. Did you ever meet so and so from this company? Hey. Why is there no whatever on this thing?

[0:40:59] Founders (1557: Like, it is unreal, and it's a huge pain in every sales rep was asked and more importantly, with their managers. Like, because they're asking questions because they don't know, and they're supposed to give some forecast to the board. Yeah. Anyways, that's where all this comes from for this piece.

[0:41:12] Founders (1557: Exactly. I I wanna also expand on that a little bit. Because those questions, the the call at 11:00 of, hey. How did this deal get through is it's really because of this is me verbally processing a bit, so it's not

[0:41:27] Founders (1557: making a assumption I

[0:41:28] Founders (1557: know. So please Yeah. Correct me. It's the sales manager is saying, I wanna know how close we actually are to this month. Mhmm.

[0:41:35] Founders (1557: And so I need to know what's in our funnel. Okay. I'm looking at my funnel. I'm now I'm finding side hustle. I'm looking at the deals that are most likely to close.

[0:41:42] Founders (1557: This week, seven deals were supposed to close, but it looks like James has fell off. So I wanna know, like, where that is now inside that deal when I'm looking at it, and it's okay. Something went off here. Now I'm signing. James.

[0:41:53] Founders (1557: What happens? But where really is my how likely might hit quota this month? And so it's kind of backing down to, like, what those initial questions are and saying, like, I I really want someone to tell me where. Like, I'm probably not getting any quota. Why is that what happened?

[0:42:09] Founders (1557: What reps aren't aren't doing those things?

[0:42:11] Founders (1557: Yes. And I think it actually differs based upon the point in time. So as an example, if you have a monthly quota and I'm a CRO, my my first question that I want to answered on, like, January 1 is not, are we gonna hit quota for the month? Is do we have enough deals in pipeline Yeah. That, like, help me get there?

[0:42:28] Founders (1557: So it's it's less about closing. It's more about are there enough leads at all funnel to convert to then a waterfall down to the the the quota taking piece. So it goes beyond just the, am I gonna hit quota? It's also do I have enough pipeline at the top of funnel right now to then get to the piece where January 20 or whatever it is, then it ask myself, do I have enough to go? So I can answer that question in the future by looking at the top of funnel now.

[0:42:52] Founders (1557: And for these phases, is it both that the sales manager persona and also the reps on Tanner and say because it's the same question. Right, Tanner? It's like, do I have

[0:43:00] Founders (1557: enough in my pipeline? Yes. Yes, sir. Basically, yes. So this is this caters to both personas, I would say, but I I still rep around a persona that you sell to.

[0:43:14] Founders (1557: Yeah. There's just, like, influencers in the. So this is more about for the manager, CRO, stuff like that where the value prop is we make your reps more efficient. Right? When we give you visibility of why people start running in this and, like, give you ability to quantify it and make sure that, like, take action upon.

[0:43:31] Founders (1557: Like, some of the thing that but it's more James at work. I'm gonna need to slash that to a, you where it's, hey. What happened to this deal? If I have if I'm in HubSpot and I have the ability to ask over here what happened in this deal, dude, money at that point. Like, that that's the exact thing that I need because then it looks across all of my activities, looks across all of my, you know, deal data points, all that stuff.

[0:43:55] Founders (1557: Like, that is the big, big, big thing. Do sell it for me because you're you're delivering context at any given time. No matter you know? This is why we call it AI sales manager. This is still, like, working work in progress, but we didn't wanna call it, like, the AI quota attainment, DG or whatever it is because you think beyond just quota, it goes to the lead gen piece of it, like, conversion piece of it, and all that.

[0:44:20] Founders (1557: But having that embedded inside of HubSpot where they're looking to get those questions answered is massive, massive. And this is why when I'm trying to sell this as this is a replacement for your sales admin or, you know, sales or personal, whatever it is, this actually just gives you the exact need to be quicker and makes everyone at, like, holding. We're straying away from the concept of we're replacing humans. It's we're making your existing humans way better, and this is exactly what we're doing in terms of situation and problem and how can that that model works for it on purpose. The thing that

[0:44:57] Founders (1557: I like about that is that's what he's you've met him. Right? Yeah. Okay. So that's our Yeah.

[0:45:02] Founders (1557: That's that's our whole model. It's, like, making work more human. Yeah. Like, for for sales reps, it's can you spend more time on the phone actually flows in the dune instead of doing the CRM? Yep.

[0:45:12] Founders (1557: And just cross every industry. So I love that.

[0:45:14] Founders (1557: Yeah. Section makes sense. Like, the I mean, this is Yeah. Basically just the contact delivery aspect of building up the deal diagnostics and HubSpot, the AskElephant, stuff like that, and giving people the ability to understand it at a deal level. I think that's that's kind of what I don't think I'm speaking a lot about it.

[0:45:31] Founders (1557: That's really what a major value prop is is that HubSpot reporting only goes so far to give you the ability to drill down into the things that you need to understand. If I go to HubSpot dashboard, I can see, like, there's my payment volume. And if I have, like, a like, this is a good example of, um, I'm drilling down into, like, our recurring revenue from, like, May, but I don't have the ability to go and figure out okay. I have this question that I need to answer, how I'm gonna go into it. So can you even close to the record itself?

[0:46:04] Founders (1557: I'm I'm stuck in this table view, and I can just see the data and then kinda make a guess when I'm gonna go back and search for the specific payment of the order itself. Saying that you are delivering is this context in each individual deal, which whereas if that's exactly what the reps will be, exactly what the managers will be, exactly what they like CROs look because they there's no longer digging for context. It's surfaced to them to answer those questions.

[0:46:29] Founders (1557: We we've been playing with the playing with is not the right phrase, but we've been, um, ideating on having some sort of smart table inside of AskElephant. We we keep on calling employee tables, but the intent is not for it to be top of funnel. It's a lot more this phase three of what you're talking about. How do you get some sort of report about signals? Things that have been said, not so much the quantitative data, but the qualitative things that people are saying.

[0:46:55] Founders (1557: For example, like, if you have a check here, you're doing slides now with, uh, School AI. Yeah. And three weeks from now, you wanna go back to School AI and say, hey. We we wanna do an audit to see if it's actually stating who of your sales reps are using those and say, okay. Across the last 100 calls, who used the first five phases or whatever it may be?

[0:47:14] Founders (1557: And then what objections were raised, what weren't raised, how does that compare before? And so having that dynamic team, but also the chat with it, say, okay. This is the dataset I wanna work with. Now that you have the calls in context, tell me a little bit more. Help me dig into, like, what actually happened.

[0:47:29] Founders (1557: Is that is that what you're getting at?

[0:47:31] Founders (1557: Yeah. And that's where I think the huge case of having, a NASA elephant embedded inside of bucket deal record Yeah. Is very powerful because the primary use of the in HubSpot currently is let

[0:47:45] Founders (1557: me show you here.

[0:47:45] Founders (1557: And the is their native AI side.

[0:47:47] Founders (1557: Yeah. Exactly. So what it'll do is it's, you know, it's running right now to summarize the record. I'd ask a question, but there's also a separate resection where you can kinda generate prompts, and and you can say, hey. Create a report based on this.

[0:48:00] Founders (1557: And it shouldn't create some report. It does not tell you, like, here's what I'm reading based on this data, and here's recommendation. But it's it's lacking that next step. It's lacking that. And, like, it's just taking it a face value.

[0:48:12] Founders (1557: It's a very transactional process where it's here to be neat. I'm done. And one thing what you're saying is here's we where we can surface the data, and here's what we're getting. They start building up the revenue intelligence piece. That's what people want.

[0:48:23] Founders (1557: It's, like, a deeper

[0:48:23] Founders (1557: way out.

[0:48:24] Founders (1557: Yeah. Because, again, correct me if I'm wrong, but the bigger piece is the numbers are great. Actually, I had a experience like this with Sam when we were going through some of our early usage metrics, and it was we've really only got two scales here, but it's not imperative to anything. Like, how useful is this actually is? Because what you're trying to do with the data is always what can I actually do?

[0:48:45] Founders (1557: Like, how can I impact? You know, how do I get us closer to actually, like, improving our probability of closing? How do I actually get us there? So it's of course, we wanna see the data. That's what helps inform decisions, but it's well, I'm now well informed, but what decisions can I actually make?

[0:48:59] Founders (1557: What can I do? Is it hey. You actually do need to call up James because it's, hey, James. This guy said he wanted to sign. He never sent the contract.

[0:49:05] Founders (1557: It's been four days.

[0:49:06] Founders (1557: Yeah. It's like, James,

[0:49:07] Founders (1557: what's up? That's why you're getting

[0:49:08] Founders (1557: a call eleven down instead of, hey. Did you ever send a contract?

[0:49:11] Founders (1557: It's not a good with two weeks notice too. Yeah.

[0:49:14] Founders (1557: I think the what would be cool if you're considering building out the flight table experience is the thing that we do with all of our services is when we're building dashboards or sort of like the business intelligence is we go to Fort HubSpot as an example share it to this is our instance, and

[0:49:37] Founders (1557: I just got I'm not sure if

[0:49:38] Founders (1557: you're client one, but you just happen to see real Fortin HubSpot. There's a question above it, which is what does this report answer? I'm looking at it. Whereas, like, I'm looking at this, and I should be able to answer these questions. That guy was looking at it to understand this is what the data is about.

[0:49:55] Founders (1557: Well, it's it's it's actually an appointment of, like, so what? I like, I can see the total payment volume by month. So what what am I supposed to do? What's the action I'm supposed to take? What's the purpose of me looking at this?

[0:50:05] Founders (1557: And I think if you're gonna hit the wall of we won't start to have foundational best practice builds or sort of template files, resources, stuff like that, Having those questions is very powerful because most people are just responding to pain, which is, I don't know what deals are gonna close. I'm I'm gonna misquote them. That's my problem. It's like, okay. Well, you should try to answer a piece of question, which is why are deals not closing?

[0:50:27] Founders (1557: What's still a funnel that has high probability closing? Blah blah blah. And build that out in the visualization and surface the data with those, like, not in front, but a a guiding question and how to think about stuff makes the user understand the problem a lot further in the mind if you're guiding them to what they wanna get to by salvaging the cost. The the actual problem issue.

[0:50:51] Founders (1557: Have you used the Meetup Revit side AskElephant much? Yes. It it makes me it it's similar to that. It's like, here's your. Yeah.

[0:51:02] Founders (1557: Because sometimes we will we'll give that to clients. They're like, oh, cool. Now I know what we talked about, but I can't remember that. Part of it is the. Like, yeah, Dan, I

[0:51:10] Founders (1557: think we're coming back from a deal.

[0:51:12] Founders (1557: We might actually close this, but they had a huge concern about the call in more process. So what? The first thing you should talk about is, hey. I talked with my team. We actually know that we can't ignore calls.

[0:51:23] Founders (1557: These are a couple different options that we have. I wanna put that up front. So now it's not we have a super good conversation. We have five minutes left. Oh, by the way, here's this line.

[0:51:31] Founders (1557: Is that similar? Like, how is it actually actionable? How was that question answered?

[0:51:37] Founders (1557: Yeah. I would say so. I mean, the VA summary, I think, is useful for teams that are not back to back in meetings all day, like, what a sales rep would be. Because a sales rep, my hypothesis would be that if you're working in the sales or your BDR or whatever it is, you're empowered dialing, start to close the business all day. Do wanna get

[0:51:56] Founders (1557: in the call? One on meeting to see yeah. I want it in

[0:52:00] Founders (1557: my face so that when I'm looking at the person, I'm not having to I don't have to try to give it three minutes before the call to read a summary and refresh myself on context. Like, I ER don't have time. Don't worry about what to do that, frankly. Just have a PED that I pay for a sales rep. For some reason, I'll cock of success who is not on the phone all day, extremely helpful because I have time to crack the experience of what I need.

[0:52:25] Founders (1557: I mean, the only use case I'm gonna sell would be for selling, like, high dollar, I think 10 deals a year or 10 deals a month type thing, and I'm not Howard Island all day. That's helpful. But, ultimately, it's the first place I'm gonna go to when it's, like, time for, like, a deal or time for me to have a meeting with someone is here in Household. First of all, because this is my place of 100,000 back to after the meeting is done or after one call note for the day to update my deal amounts if I notice, hey. They have 30 licenses instead of 20.

[0:52:55] Founders (1557: I go update my deal amount. Right? I'm not gonna go to AskElephant. I'm not gonna go back to the company record and say,

[0:53:02] Founders (1557: oh, hey. Can you borrow a

[0:53:03] Founders (1557: new decision maker on the call? I'm not I'm not gonna just label all that stuff. Like, I'm not gonna do this in sales room because I'm lazy, but I just wanna make money. And this is where, like, again, the problem is if you can extract those and do that for the rep. You can you can name them to be lazy and effective.

[0:53:19] Founders (1557: You know I mean? It's really, I guess, really the the the major problem is when you do that. How does how does that work? Like, going back to the

[0:53:26] Founders (1557: dashboard you were showing, how does that

[0:53:28] Founders (1557: work currently for reps?

[0:53:29] Founders (1557: Like, how do they get to that so what? Do they usually just not get there, or do they like, how do they how

[0:53:36] Founders (1557: do they find that out, I don't

[0:53:37] Founders (1557: know, without the interface telling? I I don't I don't think they choose the answer, or they show up at the confidence, which I have to find from there. I mean, it's literally the left of my sales reps is that they either they might log a note on the deal record, which is, you know, here's my context to put under you know, I talked about on my last call. But I guess ultimately, it's just muscle memory as a rep and just using that to guide yourself to the sales process. Like, I

[0:54:02] Founders (1557: would I would argue, I

[0:54:04] Founders (1557: mean, in my experience, that most sales reps probably don't look at dashboards at all in HubSpot, and they just look at deals. Like, as a rep, the only group that work that I don't wanna see but this is this is the deal. This is the dashboard over here. As a as a sales rep, they only look for them. I don't see is if I'm gonna hit boil.

[0:54:22] Founders (1557: That's pretty much it.

[0:54:23] Founders (1557: All I to say, one thing they might look at is a stack ranking of how they stack with their peers that they know manager with me.

[0:54:29] Founders (1557: Yeah. Jake's love that.

[0:54:32] Founders (1557: He's he's getting everything to look at,

[0:54:33] Founders (1557: like, where he's at. Like,

[0:54:35] Founders (1557: that doesn't have more sense. Costco shoes. Right? You know? Yeah.

[0:54:38] Founders (1557: He he has more. Got more.

[0:54:43] Founders (1557: The rest is all kind of just, like, unstructured intuition. Like, they just kinda figure out

[0:54:47] Founders (1557: how to get you know, that's what most sales experiences are. You're not that great. Sales is sales is like a quick and dirty, but I'm seeing it most. It's it's not super structured unless you have some homes really get as needed to make it structured. But there's a reason why, like, platforms like that like I mentioned, EBSTA, the forecasting tool, there's a reason why platforms like that exist.

[0:55:12] Founders (1557: EBSTA. EBSTA. It's a it's a fucking tool.

[0:55:16] Founders (1557: Oh, it's a tool? I think it's a tool.

[0:55:18] Founders (1557: I thought

[0:55:18] Founders (1557: it was

[0:55:19] Founders (1557: Most forecasting tools aren't that great. Yeah. So it's hard to get bad data bad data.

[0:55:25] Founders (1557: Exactly. Yeah. Like, it you get then this is again, back on the point of, like, AskElephant's really only successful if you have the right bill or, like, data, right chart, and stuff like that. AskElephant is a glorified forecasting tool that gives you the real like, this over here where it's like, This has more colleagues. Blah.

[0:55:41] Founders (1557: Beanbo next week blah blah blah. Like, this doesn't work unless the CRM is built the right way. And this is why this they they're they got acquired, but it was, like, a safe, actually, because they failed massively in the HubSpot marketplace. And so people resource platforms like this because they think that a system will solve my issue that I have. Well, the root cause is not on your system or the root cause is not you're locking this thing over here.

[0:56:05] Founders (1557: It's a misdesign of what you currently have. It's because you have a lack of process, lack of structure, lack of, you know, initiative because reps are, like, broke cowboys, and you kinda have to lean into that because restaurant really changed behavior all that much.

[0:56:18] Founders (1557: He is a standard sales rep.

[0:56:20] Founders (1557: Yeah. That's

[0:56:28] Founders (1557: I

[0:56:33] Founders (1557: I think this is super helpful just, like, to see how your team is, like, how you're going to attack the marketplace with AskElephant. Right? Like, not to say that, like, their goal is to find more partners out there that

[0:56:45] Founders (1557: are like, deep as your unique. Right? But

[0:56:48] Founders (1557: more so just helping to define, like, if we wanna get AskElephant into every sales organization in the world, It's not by hiring a million reps. It's like, okay. Hey. Do you have the relationships? Like, how can we work with you to integrate with your business and then build from there?

[0:57:04] Founders (1557: And so, obviously, they're not I wanna, like, work with you. Okay. What is what is that relationship, like, have to look like to get to the point in which where you're at? Mhmm. I think that'll help us grow specifically in that area, but also, like, as a product.

[0:57:21] Founders (1557: Right? Like and I'm I'm sure, like, we'll continue this cycle of feedback. But if there is a little hanging fruit that you'll meet with clients and you'll hear this or that a few separate times, it's like, okay.

[0:57:32] Founders (1557: Hey. Let's get on

[0:57:34] Founders (1557: a call. Let's let's see if we can, like, attack something where maybe it's an hour of time that's put in, and we're able to solve something drastic. And it's like, oh, that opens up a whole new market.

[0:57:46] Founders (1557: Yeah. So This is super exciting.

[0:57:49] Founders (1557: Yeah. I mean, I'll I'll show you a little bit of an example that I think is pretty relevant to this. So here we go. So this is the one I was talking about, Arches Golf. This is the the tooling button.

[0:58:02] Founders (1557: The

[0:58:02] Founders (1557: No. No. This is Is that Host? Oh, sorry.

[0:58:05] Founders (1557: Different different company. But this is the largest housewides I've ever seen before. They spend, like, $50 a month with housewides. Crazy stuff. So you know, you're they they basically acquire golf clubs and resorts and stuff like that, and they're in corporate private equity of golf organizations essentially.

[0:58:24] Founders (1557: And like, I'm about to pitch them, like, on AskElephant because they do have thousands of reps. And the thing that we find is

[0:58:32] Founders (1557: I love that, by the way.

[0:58:34] Founders (1557: I think we're I will I will personally

[0:58:36] Founders (1557: Yeah. Do what I'm saying. The thing the thing that we find with this is that their usage of AskElephant is

[0:58:44] Founders (1557: but we have

[0:58:45] Founders (1557: to work on their HubSpot build first before they can see value with AskElephant is what has to happen. We can't introduce it in that new because the the client use it as my HubSpot account. Don't fully trust it. So why am I adding another system to add more data to it on top of shit? That's the most common thing that I run into when I'm working with this with customers, which oftentimes, like, the the deal that we referred out already, the help of the customers that have converted are at the end of their sales or at the end of their customer cycle with us because they're on a clean build.

[0:59:15] Founders (1557: And that's why it's a no brainer. It's a good sales process because there is no objection of my house my account sucks. I don't trust my data. So we've already done all that stuff before it's gotten to you. So

[0:59:25] Founders (1557: Well, basically, prevents us from

[0:59:26] Founders (1557: having clients that we do.

[0:59:27] Founders (1557: Yeah. Yeah. Have you met with our before AskElephant? I met them last week. So they're this this is what they're doing first.

[0:59:35] Founders (1557: So I'm gonna show you this in our instance, actually. Our first scope with them is actually sales enablement for their team because their team doesn't like HubSpot. They don't like using it. It's painful part of the experience. And so what we're doing right now is

[0:59:53] Founders (1557: If only there is a tool that they could work out.

[0:59:56] Founders (1557: Yeah. It's this is what we're doing right now. But I'm gonna make sure my entire notes and blow it up by the call extension. Cool. So the thing we're doing now is, like, this is this is where super, really shots of problems.

[1:00:14] Founders (1557: So you have, like, these little rules here of, like, needs activity, needs to close date, stuff like that.

[1:00:18] Founders (1557: I don't think they know what their needs. So for reference real quick, it there's a property that lives on a record somewhere, and super process rules allow the rep, no matter where they

[1:00:27] Founders (1557: are on HubSpot Oh. To be

[1:00:29] Founders (1557: a flag if something's not right. Yep. That's so that's that's he's on a view, and this is highlighting, hey. Someone on this record deep down that's not visible to you easily. I'm gonna pull this out and blimp your face because it's wrong.

[1:00:40] Founders (1557: Exactly.

[1:00:40] Founders (1557: And this is where we're we're combining this tool with AskElephant to do stuff like this. So as an example, if we wanna say, hey. Show me every deal that has a meeting score of less than five or whatever it is or does not have a valid problem that resonates based upon what how we're enriching the HubSpot data, what we can do is go to this here called Sales Rep Trainer. It's going to aggregate I don't have any users here. It's all under.

[1:01:03] Founders (1557: So I'm gonna select all

[1:01:04] Founders (1557: of these. And this is Is this the same?

[1:01:07] Founders (1557: Is this a little sidebar extension?

[1:01:09] Founders (1557: It's a it's a white little version of super. Okay. Yeah. So we can press play, and it brings the deals to the reps to go and fix, which is, hey. Things are closed today.

[1:01:18] Founders (1557: It still doesn't have a company associated stuff like that and tells the rep what what needs to happen. And so for for Arsys, which is the the customer I showed you before, before we can get to the AskElephant stage of, hey. Let's make it easier for your reps to input data, we have to retroactively fix a lot of the current stuff that's in pipeline right now because the data is so bad. Okay. So there's I mean, I

[1:01:41] Founders (1557: think I meant you were mentioning this as I walked in is that, like, one of that pieces is trying to find incorrect associations to make sure that they're correct. That's what Palmer's been spending a lot of work on. So it's almost like, what if you have this in context, but also ask Ale to check and see. Is there a company that's associated to it? Can we make that association?

[1:01:58] Founders (1557: If not, you need to create that company.

[1:02:00] Founders (1557: Yep. That one that that process is very powerful if you can build that out. There's certain use cases you'll run into. Like, our system is a scenario because they work with really your industry, and they have parent companies and child companies. And so followers do a great job of uniquely distinguishing those where you have, like, a private equity firm in the Port Coast.

[1:02:23] Founders (1557: Port Coast would be child companies, and there isn't a way to know that. Arsys owns the Woodlands Country Club. Completely different domains. Arsys isn't like Arizona. The Woodlands Country Club is in Texas.

[1:02:34] Founders (1557: So there's some, like, relational intelligence you may have

[1:02:37] Founders (1557: to figure out. So why we

[1:02:39] Founders (1557: this is exactly why we use clay to find that stuff out and try to match those sources together. But the answer is yes, but you may already see more of that.

[1:02:48] Founders (1557: What is your pitch to to Arsys as a partner? Like or when you're approaching how

[1:02:53] Founders (1557: many how many referrals have you sent us by the

[1:02:55] Founders (1557: way? I know. Yeah.

[1:02:56] Founders (1557: I'll I'll

[1:02:56] Founders (1557: be honest. So so less than 2,000.

[1:03:00] Founders (1557: Yeah. But not much less.

[1:03:02] Founders (1557: See one bit. I'm taking

[1:03:03] Founders (1557: the product question,

[1:03:04] Founders (1557: but but, yeah, what is what is your pitch to people that haven't heard AskElephant? Because I think I'm biased by what our sales team is saying. We're saying it's very different from you're using the platform. You've been there, and it's not like,

[1:03:15] Founders (1557: hey. This is

[1:03:16] Founders (1557: what we want people to say about AskElephant. Like, what is what's that into

[1:03:19] Founders (1557: your introduction? Yeah. It's mainly so there's two things. One is whenever I get in a call with someone and they have Fathom or Otter or whatever it is, I immediately slash the fuck out of those platforms immediately. I'm like, this is a horrendous platform.

[1:03:33] Founders (1557: Like, I just use this. Like, ask how it looks way better. Do you believe that? Absolutely. Absolute.

[1:03:38] Founders (1557: Why is that? Fountain wanted to pay us $50 a year to show off,

[1:03:42] Founders (1557: like, partnership with Seabird. I was like, yeah.

[1:03:45] Founders (1557: Yeah. Fathom is, like, fucking I would say it's like the. They should be.

[1:03:50] Founders (1557: Yeah. And I told them,

[1:03:52] Founders (1557: was like, you guys are seriously under, like, where you guys should be in terms of product. The product just sucks. So number one is, like, the reason we sell a lot of it is, like, value is terrible, and, like, other platforms, like, the worst. And then number two is I show them very simply. I'm like, hey.

[1:04:09] Founders (1557: Watch this. I'm gonna go and say these specific things. I'm gonna say, hey. There is this customer team's RevOps. They have a $50,000 budget blah blah blah.

[1:04:20] Founders (1557: Slack gets pinged immediately. And I show them the bot and the message that gets created and the prompt that is generated from there as well, and I show them live on screen share. And I'm like, I just fly an upsell opportunity for me talking to the laptop, and I'm, back here, showing hands the entire time. But, like, I'm just, woah. I'm like, think about the other possibilities of that.

[1:04:39] Founders (1557: So your sales team's going and qualifying stuff, and you want to know what are the value of that resonate, what are the most common traits of my customers, how do they respond to certain types of language, stuff like that. You can't extract that with HubSpot data right now. You just can't. I can extract it just with by listening to what reps are communicating to people with a method that they do. And so it's more about you're helping to answer the questions that people are unable to answer or maybe they don't need a thing to ask.

[1:05:09] Founders (1557: And that's what resonates with the the customers that we end up sending to you guys is stuff like that, which is it's not so much here's what I can do. It's let me show you the experience and how I'm gonna use it. And that's how I wanna go sell most platforms. It's like, I believe in the product, so I'm sure exactly how to use it. Like so why are my sales processes so good?

[1:05:29] Founders (1557: Because of systems like this.

[1:05:32] Founders (1557: And I think it works so well because you guys are the trusted advisers already. So it's not like you're coming in as this fake sales guru. It's you're already ingrained into their sales process. So, like, that's why our partnership, like, is going to be so successful because, like, they are already the experts. We are building this cool product that helps Kevin and his team work even better to make their products stickier.

[1:05:58] Founders (1557: So so have you set up any of those instances and ask all of for those clients to try to get that set up? Like, how long does that process take for you right Like, what are

[1:06:09] Founders (1557: those main points? It's easy. Like, the the reason why it's easy, though, is because we usually introduce it now. What's the end of, like, the first scope with us where the CRM doesn't doubles the rate. And so doing AskElephant workflow is, like, a ten minute process at that point because I know the structured data is there already because I built it.

[1:06:27] Founders (1557: Someone else on the team built it. Whereas it's not impossible for us to sell upfront, but it means that we're selling kind of multiple states in tandem, which is I'm selling you the HubSpot build, and I gotta factor in how AskElephant maps into these properties and your object architecture and how your sales team go with the vision methodology and all that stuff, which is that's when I'm telling you, this is where the provider piece what you need to get very important for success.

[1:06:50] Founders (1557: That's so that that just, like, launched my a couple of months ago where all I was doing was, like, trying to

[1:06:57] Founders (1557: help people, like, be that consultative Yeah.

[1:06:59] Founders (1557: Provider Mhmm. But with no true sales expertise outside of this is what

[1:07:04] Founders (1557: I see work. Like, I have

[1:07:05] Founders (1557: two years. I actually left sales because I wasn't that good at it. Like, I was okay. Um, and then those like, whether it's partners or direct sales, people that come to us and say, hey. I want to automate my CRM.

[1:07:18] Founders (1557: Yeah. Because that's that's what we we sell. Right? It's that that idea. So I have a

[1:07:22] Founders (1557: question on this one. I'm glad you're sold out. Uh, like, things like this that have a lot of notes, there's a copy paste feature that's supposed to be cut out, so you can use copy from your system. So it's it's it's out right now, but it's had a couple bugs.

[1:07:35] Founders (1557: That's great. So it should be not released. But I'm so sorry.

[1:07:41] Founders (1557: But I was just gonna say I'd love to sit with you after later and go through some of the workflows, and These are great. Try some of the the new things that we've updated just to not have to have so many notes, see if they're actually reliable testing.

[1:07:54] Founders (1557: I'm sorry about

[1:07:54] Founders (1557: an update. Yes.

[1:07:55] Founders (1557: Didn't realize you're still using search field and update field,

[1:07:57] Founders (1557: and it's updating field if you want too.

[1:07:59] Founders (1557: Yeah. Agent's way better.

[1:08:02] Founders (1557: This is one of the prompts. I was like, cool. I'm happy.

[1:08:05] Founders (1557: Oh, this is what the AI builder? Yeah.

[1:08:08] Founders (1557: So, basically, what the way I

[1:08:09] Founders (1557: do this is I I plug in my prompt. I think I've got my search on pretty well, and then I just kinda optimize and iterate. But I'll give an example of here is where I think point of failure could possibly happen. It was about one. Was doing testing on this, and it failed on the search deals with AI.

[1:08:26] Founders (1557: Yes. Well,

[1:08:27] Founders (1557: then that's why it's better.

[1:08:28] Founders (1557: That's what yeah. Yeah. But, like, I'm

[1:08:30] Founders (1557: I as a customer, if I'm building this on my own without a provider, I wouldn't know this.

[1:08:33] Founders (1557: I'd be like, well, I'm gonna

[1:08:35] Founders (1557: give up, and then I'll go back to HubSpot and do my manual shit. You know? Like, status quo is much easier for me than diagnosing her.

[1:08:41] Founders (1557: That is I mean, I have applied so deeply with that because it will you actually close this and add I think you're adding a new HubSpot. I didn't Just add a

[1:08:54] Founders (1557: new HubSpot to it anywhere. Just anywhere? Yeah. We can get

[1:08:56] Founders (1557: rid of it. And this will be me showing

[1:08:59] Founders (1557: our cards, Michael, right,

[1:09:00] Founders (1557: trying to improve. So the HubSpot agent in the top left is the that open field, right, where you can it it basically got to the actual side of AskElephant.

[1:09:09] Founders (1557: It's the only one I actually trust.

[1:09:11] Founders (1557: And, yeah, it's it's very verbose. Will you click and add one more HubSpot number? Just show that HubSpot tab again as if you're creating a new node off of

[1:09:24] Founders (1557: This one?

[1:09:24] Founders (1557: So yeah. So oh, yeah. If you'll delete the purchase date.

[1:09:28] Founders (1557: I didn't know.

[1:09:28] Founders (1557: You're right.

[1:09:28] Founders (1557: So Stay on the screen. So now I'll see contacts. Most of everything that is is there, all those other notes are things that it's exactly what I'm saying where we have that experience of we're not finding the right deals. It's not creating associations. We're not updating the right property and really struggling through that.

[1:09:46] Founders (1557: I'm of the opinion that we should either deprecate or hide a lot of these. They're fully legacy nodes that we've been approved upon. Right? Do you have any theoretical theory? Yeah.

[1:09:56] Founders (1557: So and and part of the thing is, like, I think that you've done some incredible stuff with at least subpar tools that we're trying to improve upon. If you scroll down a little bit on this field like this structured HubSpot agent integration around specific meeting time.

[1:10:14] Founders (1557: You guys

[1:10:14] Founders (1557: don't even there? Is James sufficient?

[1:10:17] Founders (1557: James is I've heard. Just kidding.

[1:10:21] Founders (1557: It's me.

[1:10:21] Founders (1557: It is Skyler. Hey.

[1:10:24] Sam Ho: To meet you.

[1:10:29] Founders (1557: I guess what I'm getting at is I this is relevant for you too. A lot of

[1:10:34] Founders (1557: these Yeah. I've just been chiming in. This is Craig so far.

[1:10:37] Founders (1557: Yeah. I think that we should deprecate a lot of these notes to make it a lot more clear of what we can do to simplify because,

[1:10:42] Founders (1557: you know, I I I think that a good example of this, and I mentioned this earlier, is, like, people struggle with Zapier for the exact reason. Yep. Where it's like Zaps end up erring out because they don't know the right action to take. There's too many options, and so that hasn't been crossed. If this is already super was on the right track with this, which is the process becomes the prompt.

[1:11:05] Founders (1557: That's the idea behind, like, the AI usage inside of super. And I think that getting to the stage or having just just the HubSpot agent and nothing else, that is the the direction I guess would be the most efficient. So you're gonna have way better usage, less confusion, less error, stuff like that.

[1:11:26] Founders (1557: You you you've used the workflow builder. Correct? If the workflow builder was instead, you could just say, I only wanna focus on, like, HubSpot processes, and you basically have that HubSpot agent, and then it creates, like, the structure. This is the property update. This is the property that use cases, the condition that it runs.

[1:11:42] Founders (1557: Is that preferable to seeing, like, a 20 node output?

[1:11:49] Founders (1557: I I think it depends on your user. Ask I like the the the math visual personal because I don't like red ops go to market operator, so I love to see the steps in the process start to finish. For a manager or an agent, I think the experience would be, I build this and never look at it again and know that it works. Like, if and and maybe, like and this is where I'll show you this, which I think would be helpful. Yeah.

[1:12:25] Founders (1557: You see that has the last 100 records. That's beautiful. Yeah. Yeah. You can you can do the sync as well, which is cool in terms of what they do.

[1:12:35] Founders (1557: I don't think I because

[1:12:37] Founders (1557: that thing is on night and day.

[1:12:40] Founders (1557: Love it so much. There is Don't worry. Maybe you don't have access to it, but what Subaru's doing now is, uh, doing an AI summary of this process rule, which is here's what this thing does in, like, two sentences. It's very powerful because no one wants to go and read all the logic, but this is a very basic rule here. If you run 10 different groupings, you gotta understand, okay.

[1:13:06] Founders (1557: If the closing is unknown and if this rep and it's, like, this certain quarter or this specific thing, this deal type, it's really difficult to understand the type of logic. And so they have a little it's a lightning bolt icon that's not an AI suddenly what it does. But, like, if you just don't like all deals that don't have a close date in this time frame, really easy for you to understand, like, bite sized sentence. So stuff like that.

[1:13:26] Founders (1557: So we like having the general chat, yeah, feature update the description every time a node gets changed or something. That's one

[1:13:31] Founders (1557: of my other points of feedback on workflow details is when you build workflows in HubSpot, it actually auto titles and auto leads you description every time you build one. And I found it to be extremely accurate, which is great for taxonomy purposes because and my other my other submission, did a little video, like, two weeks ago on this was I want to be able to aggregate my workflows or agents into folders because I'm treated as a library because that's how I'm sell it ultimately. It's right now, it's a big list of stuff, and I have to as as fucking stupid as it sounds, having to scroll and find all my things that I'm doing is, like, not great for me. I'll need to hop into a folder and see all my things are running right now.

[1:14:12] Founders (1557: Tyler, you turn off the tags

[1:14:14] Founders (1557: and things for him too. So Yeah. I'll do that.

[1:14:16] Founders (1557: Fill I mean, that that's actually a really good point because even just having filters, that's something I come across. Our instance has actually, I've been through and deleted 480 workflows, and I think we're back up to, like, 700 maybe. And so part of it is,

[1:14:30] Founders (1557: like, if I'm scrolling through or I have to I have to

[1:14:32] Founders (1557: filter it by, like, last run date, but, yeah, having folders or something to to say, especially where I get my work done. Or this is my top of funnel workflows. This is my Yeah.

[1:14:42] Founders (1557: Like Okay. Especially, you know, as well. If you get to the realm of building out, like, the global chat inside of HubSpot, I I could see use cases for this, especially for, like, marketing teams where a marketing team could look at a contact or a company record if they're doing, like, ABM or something, and it has to go chat. Tell me, like, the basic attribution sources that will reference across the entire sales cycle to give an idea of, like, the customer touch points and how we influence revenue and having that live here. And then I wanna be able to categorize that and build a workflow in AskElephant and siphon that out into a marketing folder or a marketing workflow folder because then it's become you you turn to a global usage across the entire company, not just sales teams.

[1:15:28] Founders (1557: Because the marketing team, sales team, and service team all use HubSpot. They all have HubSpot volumes. They're all looking at the same data before what you're doing in terms of in the workflow. It says it's mainly for the sales teams right now, but there is other use cases beyond that of having, like you kinda you kinda build in, like, automatic upsell of electronic journeys inside of HubSpot for AskElephant by putting global chat across all objects for all users. How much do you

[1:16:01] Founders (1557: how much value would you find in having one place in AskElephant this? This is what the HubSpot what updates have in HubSpot by the agent, um, broken down. So it's it's not just workflows, but, like, one place where you can go and see, these are deals that have been updated. This is how many updates have been made. Um, I actually have a quick prototype that I built if it's helpful to see.

[1:16:27] Founders (1557: Is all very abrupt. The the intention of it

[1:16:30] Founders (1557: is to be able to say

[1:16:35] Founders (1557: that, like, I I know all of the workflows that are specifically running on my AskElephant instance because I'll take the bars. Like I mentioned, I can just scroll for days and days and days inside of all of the workflows that we've built. Right. Having a place to say, like, okay. This is actually what workflows have been doing, which ones 60 did, or even a place where it's, like, you get a box of, hey.

[1:17:14] Founders (1557: This is these are the things that we're actually not sure if they should or shouldn't be updated. Like, a human in loop process to say, we wanna create a new deal. However, you wanted them to flag that. We wanna create duplicate deals. Or is this something that you'd even want inside of that panel in the house lock?

[1:17:31] Founders (1557: You're still in that place of work. Do wanna do a little bit of a sort of path to?

[1:17:38] Founders (1557: I I've been in my I trace back to initial thought process. Like, so what? What does it do for me? You know what mean? Because that's how I keep my hands clean.

[1:17:47] Founders (1557: So it sounds like Yeah. And that's not an unless I'm an admin if I'm an admin of the tool and it's a core function of my job, like, yes. If I'm, like, a CRO who's managing a sales team and VR and all that stuff, I'm like, yes. It's nice to have, but am I gonna use it? Probably not.

[1:18:06] Founders (1557: Like, I'm gonna have an admin go with my ticker and stuff. It's more about I I think of what does this do for me, and what questions can I answer by using this? And I think that showing the workflows that have stopped working altogether because, like, a field was deleted in HubSpot or the workflow that a a recommendation. Like, this the normal thing that has a super around process rules was the AI tool should recommend the next process rule based upon current data that we see. If that's what that does, amazing.

[1:18:41] Founders (1557: And that would be cool. It says something like, hey. When we see it's almost like you have that that interface that would say, hey. We see these these workflows running. You're kinda missing this one over here that we recommend.

[1:18:51] Founders (1557: That would be extremely powerful.

[1:18:53] Founders (1557: So we were talking about this months ago. Like, I I'm thinking about it like the full sales spam, right, being able to say, we have workflows in each instance. You're actually you're missing handoff piece that's not there. Is that what you're saying? Yeah.

[1:19:08] Founders (1557: Exactly.

[1:19:11] Founders (1557: Yeah. That that people want that quickest time to value without having to think about it as end users and stuff like that makes a big difference. This is what like in HubSpot. In HubSpot, one of the most common dashboard used across the entire HubSpot ecosystem is. It's the basic ask create dashboard.

[1:19:34] Founders (1557: It's still a manager one.

[1:19:39] Founders (1557: Oh, I hate this dashboard.

[1:19:40] Founders (1557: They're fucking terrible, but everyone uses the

[1:19:43] Founders (1557: Somebody has no notes. Somebody needs to report why you needed it. So it's it's so many reasons.

[1:19:49] Founders (1557: I'll have to go first. These are the most commonly used reports by end users of HubSpot, and there's 260,000 users just like this in terms of companies, and they're the most common ones that that get used. And Helicbot optimizes the the templatized version of the AdWords based upon the submissions they get from other CMS team, which is, hey. I also wanna see this specific thing. Yeah.

[1:20:14] Founders (1557: And that's how they build this stuff out here. Television.

[1:20:16] Founders (1557: And it also ends up with some CRO with me being like, oh, we have 4,000 contacts created this month. Marketing must be getting great. It's like, no. Yes. An SDR did a CSV upload.

[1:20:26] Founders (1557: Yeah. On January 1, none of this is marketing. You just wasted $50,000. Like, genuinely, like, there's decisions that are made so poorly when they base it off just that dashboard. It is it's just far too insufficient.

[1:20:40] Founders (1557: And that

[1:20:40] Founders (1557: that's why that prompt even they showed up, like, the HubSpot on config is not super applicable to everyone because there's stuff like that where the prompt may analyze, oh, a bunch of lead you're created, but not looking at the source or the method or the unsubscribe rate, stuff like that. Because that's a deep drill down into the data to get there.

[1:20:59] Founders (1557: Yeah. And that's the the people that are looking at the reports aren't the people that either have the time, the knowledge, or the desire to go and say, I'll answer those deals. It's just, I don't even care. We got more leads. We're gonna give more 300 k more, but it's James who gets mad to say, no.

[1:21:16] Founders (1557: Please.

[1:21:17] Founders (1557: Yeah. We gotta yeah. So missing context always in CRM bills that requires deep dives that but AI is just not not powerful enough to go into this CRMs yet. I think it's gonna get there, but right now, it's you have to go and manually deep dive into the data to look at why has this happened when it's happened and that'll be it inside the business. And then you realize your phone's fucked, and then you use Excel sheets.

[1:21:44] Founders (1557: And that's how most businesses end up. They don't get data on this as well. Go to Excel sheets.

[1:21:50] Founders (1557: I literally had last night where I was on call with a customer, and they were like, yeah. Our CSPs excel. It's just losing my mind.

[1:21:59] Founders (1557: Yeah. Until December, we're out of the forecast today. So Yeah. That's right. And it was all in all.

[1:22:06] Founders (1557: That's an extremely common thing. But I don't yeah. Many market companies and and SMB definitely, but extremely common. But then we're just

[1:22:16] Founders (1557: going forth. They're notging Excel. The other piece, this is the sideline. Why is this is there all that's why I have simple reports and custom reports. I think all simple reports sustain sideline.

[1:22:28] Founders (1557: Well,

[1:22:29] Founders (1557: the thing

[1:22:29] Founders (1557: is and then this is, like, the the part of the downhill as well. I think it's worth worth knowing this because if you want to going back to the Instagram question. Right? So what he's referencing is the simple reports are the single object stuff where it's like, I wanna see deals that have a closed date of this month. Right?

[1:22:45] Founders (1557: It's a pretty easy builder, right, where you have just the drag and drop method of, like, here's the deal. It can bring it over here, blah blah blah. So this is single object. I only wanna see deals and data once you're made into teams. The next level, which is the customer report, is way more complex.

[1:23:00] Founders (1557: Wouldn't I mean, it's good for people that don't wanna build stuff where I can choose contacts, companies, deals, etcetera. But when users get here, this page, they're like, what the fuck do I do? Because the next multiple layers of business intelligence, it's knowing what data points on what objects to filter on, the time frame, the questions that you wanna answer, and the visualization configuration on top of filtering them. And this is where, like, if if you're gonna get to the the development of reporting in CRM is the primary, I would say, purchasing reason for all people invited by. Like, my reporting sucks.

[1:23:35] Founders (1557: I need a place to set up my sales team so I can have, like, good data. And this is what they have to do. Have to hire someone to build stuff like this out, answer the questions that they need to answer in HubSpot because it does

[1:23:45] Founders (1557: not come really big. So as a rep, I'm using HubSpot because if it's not, HubSpot wouldn't happen. I don't get paid unless the deal is closed and worked. So and, also, that helped me a little bit with the sales team. It's, like, a context of closing a deal.

[1:23:59] Founders (1557: Yeah. The big squeeze is probably just the the quote and the deal. Like, they're gonna get paid when the deal's closed once.

[1:24:04] Founders (1557: So I mean, you'd be surprised how many demos that I get on with people where I show them the Gmail integration. I'm like, hey. You have a meeting link. Didn't even write a calendar. That's why I was a meeting link scheduler.

[1:24:14] Founders (1557: I'm actually like, yeah. Is better than that.

[1:24:17] Founders (1557: Quite a few there's

[1:24:18] Founders (1557: not brand name things I

[1:24:19] Founders (1557: love about HubSpot, but they're. And you know what

[1:24:23] Founders (1557: I love about that comment you just made? That's an example of why the CRM bill is so hard if we're actually gonna replace HubSpot. Like and I I wasn't trying to new Brian's brain on Monday when I was going through that. But, like, pretending, like, we can have one silent experience and compete with CRMs, we're just lying to ourselves. However, there there is good yeah.

[1:24:50] Founders (1557: We we see that. Yeah.

[1:24:52] Founders (1557: But there's signal over we have customers today. We have the smaller side and on the progressive side, and that's not our job even for us. That is gonna be true for people, like, attend to blow or less in that work. Yeah. So

[1:25:05] Founders (1557: But

[1:25:07] Founders (1557: I also wonder how much of

[1:25:09] Founders (1557: that element you're getting.

[1:25:09] Founders (1557: Much of that element is people are just they're just thirsty for some. They're just well, it's a crispy point. Like, most people have terrible day. Most people don't have a good setup. So, like, the reason they're thirsty for something is because unless somebody who's done it a 100 times comes in and sets it up for them correctly, they're going to have a bad experience.

[1:25:30] Founders (1557: And that's, like, many spirits that say, I'm totally guilty. Totally. But unless that pain goes away from them, we will always have a solid argument for why we couldn't do something and why they could come over. But we're just gonna cap ourselves at, like, size of orbit comes over and shit until we have full speed. Yeah.

[1:25:52] Founders (1557: It sounds like you you do a ton of set up the HubSpot site. Is that just always the beauty of the world? Is there, like, a path forward to, like, what Tyler showed earlier when he asked the chat? They gave a bunch of wrong stuff. Like, is it so unique and so not prescriptive enough that it just has to be done every time or it needs to be a future work.

[1:26:14] Founders (1557: So that could be automated.

[1:26:16] Founders (1557: Think there is a future where some of it could be automated, but there's the element of I can look at what is currently built in HubSpot and understand how it relates to a best practice model. And the the the part where a human fits into it is I want to understand the context and how this was built, the process that was, like that you had in mind for when the geopilot was created, the methodology you can use for your sales qualification stuff like that. So if you get to that point of where you can collect that information from users and then about the audit, then you can probably get to a point where it's, yeah, the audit is perfect, where it's you say you wanna do these specific things. Here's where your account does not match up, and this is where it's gonna differ by business with their if they have a big sales team or a small sales team, if they have a sales team and CS team and stuff like that. So there's certainly gonna be some level of information collection, which is really what the human does in that process, but I do think it's possible.

[1:27:14] Founders (1557: So is there do you see a world in which sounds like, for your flow, AskElephant's in that last little 10%, is

[1:27:21] Founders (1557: why it's set up

[1:27:21] Founders (1557: as easy because you've done all that rework already. Is that a home where you feel like it should just always live, or is some of this automation could actually pull us back further or back? It really works with your boss. I think I've shared with you. We are both, like,

[1:27:34] Founders (1557: are you gonna actually be able

[1:27:35] Founders (1557: to monitor and share this link?

[1:27:38] Founders (1557: Customer, like, tooling for you. Let's do that. Or is that but we're it's the time.

[1:27:47] Founders (1557: I think it's it's the only reason that we introduce it at, like, the end of the customer life cycle right now is because we're still figuring out our own sales process and we're sell our current services. Okay. But I think the better use case is actually including it from the get go, like, piece one. Because, ultimately, the driving pain point usually for why people buy HubSpot is I want better data. I wanna be able to make decisions with better data.

[1:28:13] Founders (1557: And, like, HubSpot's not a solution for that. It's just not. It's an investment to hold your data, but it doesn't format it or manipulate it or put in the right place for you, something like that. That requires a human and or your sales team to do that stuff. So for us, the best use case for where we can include it is in the sales process, which is your pain point or your problem constraint is I want better data.

[1:28:36] Founders (1557: HubSpot's not your solution. It's HubSpot and AskElephant together because AskElephant is the delivery vessel faulted data in a fleeting way that has lands in hotspot for you to look at.

[1:28:48] Founders (1557: I'm curious. Don't see another question on that one.

[1:28:51] Founders (1557: I I mean, I'm shooting high level, but my goal is just to, like, ask questions that I want filled just to see where where your where your mind's at. This is I'm not in itself, so a of it seems to be. So I'm curious, though, like you said, that you're adjusting your own methodology, but asking twice at the end. Are there limitations in AskElephant that are stopping you from doing that, or is it literally just the process from working?

[1:29:12] Founders (1557: It is literally just the process as well.

[1:29:14] Founders (1557: Okay.

[1:29:15] Founders (1557: All the limitations that we found right now. K.

[1:29:18] Founders (1557: Would the process be easier if I was mentioning this that you recently forget when four Monday, so I still forgot. It's totally fine. I made the wrong call a while ago when we building the HubSpot agent and not letting AskElephant create infrastructure or properties in HubSpot. The reason why I'm saying the wrong call is now I'm realizing one of the main hang ups that's what you all like. Things aren't set up.

[1:29:42] Founders (1557: So if we could, in a workflow, say, it looks like they have these six fields that are being used. They're these are being used this way. These are being used this way. This workflow will update those. You also should go create these five others in order for this workflow to work.

[1:29:57] Founders (1557: Do want me

[1:29:57] Founders (1557: to go create those? I am convinced that there's something along that path that will make it way easier to adopt for everybody, but I don't know for sure. I I think it is a valuable addition, and it gives customers the ability to be self sufficient and remove the need for a service provider to make AskElephant and HubSpot successful on that one, which is good. So you should do that. Because it's still pretty slow, though, in the sense of they integrate a whole bunch of shit and bomb their account.

[1:30:25] Founders (1557: Which is why I fought against this so, like, hard at first.

[1:30:29] Founders (1557: So, like, I mean, there's always use cases where I think there's a very simple rule of check to see if this exists first before creating things. It's kind of a golden rule that you see around the universe. But you also run into and I don't want to design around use cases. Ultimately, I'm thinking about things, but this is a really big one, which is people name things in stupid ways and put them on weird in weird areas in HubSpot. And unless the AI tool is able to build a really good best practice recommendations, like, an example, if you're someone who's, like, enterprise sales that wants to collect their qualification data on a company instead of a deal for a use case, to factor stuff like that

[1:31:12] Founders (1557: That's a good point.

[1:31:14] Founders (1557: Because if it's always the deal record, that may not serve the customer's ETA.

[1:31:18] Founders (1557: So to summarize that, just for the AI notetaker, they implemented how AskElephant ever created deals or create how do you Slack infrastructure inside their instance? Issue first, look for those trends, identify them, make recommendations based off them, and always allow for the person to be like, I actually want this on the account anymore.

[1:31:37] Founders (1557: I don't if someone needs contact or whatever. Yeah.

[1:31:40] Founders (1557: Yeah. So that's that's kind where I'm going towards what the question is asking because you mentioned before, like, suggesting a workflow that you see that it's missing. My very first guy got that is the same as what we're saying. I was like, that has to be a little bit because we started having a pretty garbage workflow. Let's see.

[1:31:55] Founders (1557: Let's hear.

[1:31:56] Founders (1557: And I think it's

[1:31:57] Founders (1557: the same scenario here, Tony, where you do have some best practices. You are following or they have some kind of variation on the. And then you

[1:32:05] Founders (1557: have to come in as

[1:32:05] Founders (1557: you even identify the relationship there. So I wonder if sometimes maybe shooting for the goal completely automating is not the answer, but if you can automate some of the diagnostic process with someone like you to do it, then you could pick up where it's like, okay. I was swinging a miss here, but if four out of five times, it's actually is helpful to me.

[1:32:24] Founders (1557: Yeah. We don't know if that's.

[1:32:27] Founders (1557: Yeah. I think so. I mean, it would mean I'm not gonna say, you know, to a tool that helps me sell more stuff. Like, certain stuff was better.

[1:32:33] Founders (1557: Yeah. I think well, then I think that provides us too because we were always striving to figure out how to diagnose that. Because we've when James was referring to bullying online this last week,

[1:32:44] Founders (1557: it's because we you do wanna come

[1:32:46] Founders (1557: up with something that's a bit more structured, bit more vetting, better, because then you're gonna able to get it processed as a product. But the more we talk about it, the more we realize that just doesn't exist because there's so much variance in what people do. So exercising this ability to draw the line between what they're doing and their best practice or even a subset of the best practices that they're close enough to that you can kind of turn towards would be hugely beneficial to us

[1:33:10] Founders (1557: from a

[1:33:10] Founders (1557: product side. So we're gonna sell them to you. I think it has huge, huge benefit. I don't know if you

[1:33:16] Founders (1557: if you're

[1:33:17] Founders (1557: seeing that too, but, yeah, we would be if if we try to help you learn how you're doing it to help us build another part of

[1:33:23] Founders (1557: the product. I'll give you

[1:33:25] Founders (1557: I'd agree with you.

[1:33:26] Founders (1557: I'll give you another example of this. And I think I just found this here actually in HubSpot. HubSpot does a really good job of this in this

[1:33:36] Founders (1557: area. So Oh, this is delivered really metrics.

[1:33:41] Founders (1557: Yes. It's all about email health. They're like, the rates on scratch and all that stuff. So HubSpot, actually, you could you could measure your data against the benchmark generally across all HubSpot metrics or others in your that also use HubSpot. And so what's cool about this is, like, where IT services is what we're categorized as, like, a a business.

[1:33:59] Founders (1557: And so we can run this and understand, like, let's look at December 1 to December 31 and understand, okay. Here's where, like, we have, you know, our our data and what it looks like, and, you know, we should do the long fix that and stuff like that. So if you wanted to have maybe the stepping stone between that is, hey. Others that are in your industry that are also using AskElephant going back to, I want a best practice build, use these workflows in this, you know, style as well. Okay.

[1:34:29] Founders (1557: It's cool.

[1:34:32] Founders (1557: I just jammed that in the back of your mind. So you guys are working together. Like, if you see those things, if you think that there's some identification you can

[1:34:40] Founders (1557: make that helps, uh, even if

[1:34:43] Founders (1557: you automate small pieces of them too late to just see, like, oh, this happens a lot in connecting someone to a best practice. We should talk about that in product engineering. Can certainly give you people that very soon. Okay?

[1:34:57] Founders (1557: I will oh, okay. What else? It's just small comment for what we're

[1:35:08] Founders (1557: talking about. What what we're what we're kind of, like, trying to balance is trying to be opinionated software, where we see HubSpot is very unappealing. Even if you

[1:35:16] Founders (1557: want unlimited data, look at the dashboards, you want new charts.

[1:35:21] Founders (1557: Where we found success, so I think

[1:35:23] Founders (1557: this applies with partnership. It's like a lot of clients come to us for questions. They wanna know Yeah. How to succeed. They wanna know how to set it up.

[1:35:30] Founders (1557: We do. And so we

[1:35:34] Founders (1557: we, admittedly, we're not trying to be our CRM.

[1:35:39] Founders (1557: Yeah. We

[1:35:40] Founders (1557: again, I we're like. Even though that's

[1:35:43] Founders (1557: not the marketing is the this is what you mentioned about as well. It's true. Like, maybe maybe a CRM or or those specific set of users, but not the full text that, like, blah blah blah.

[1:35:53] Founders (1557: Yeah. That's in one area, and that's the marketing hub. Yeah. Not opinion about sales hub or any other hub that they have.

[1:36:00] Founders (1557: Yeah. Yeah. The marketing hubs.

[1:36:01] Founders (1557: It's just inbound. You know, any methodology or any content or other bullshit. But Yeah. That's nice.

[1:36:08] Founders (1557: We, you know, we we me and

[1:36:10] Founders (1557: I get, like, depressed thinking about trying to replicate or build CRM.

[1:36:15] Founders (1557: So that's what's exciting about us.

[1:36:16] Founders (1557: So there's like that's why the often statement we're, like, trying to push is, like, what are, like,

[1:36:20] Founders (1557: the common ways of practice where people aren't abused to that we have to adopt, and then what are the areas that people are thirsty for

[1:36:26] Founders (1557: us to push the boundaries, few ways of being incongated. And,

[1:36:32] Founders (1557: yeah, I think that is.

[1:36:35] Founders (1557: Some days were on the side. So

[1:36:40] Founders (1557: I mean, I think about, like, Sandler as a good example. Don't know. I'm just wondering Sandler. They were a customer at Subaru, and Fathom is a fucking massive part of as well. That's one of them.

[1:36:50] Founders (1557: We should actually go. Should go. Yeah.

[1:36:51] Founders (1557: We should We go. Go. A little bit. And who we talked to. I don't know.

[1:36:58] Founders (1557: We go to sales.

[1:36:59] Founders (1557: Are you to? Which one do we Well,

[1:37:01] Founders (1557: it's James and stuff.

[1:37:03] Founders (1557: I go on.

[1:37:04] Founders (1557: Yeah. Sales. James. A

[1:37:09] Founders (1557: Oh, yeah. Jordan's brother. I think it's James.

[1:37:11] Founders (1557: Oh, okay. Just go on. Yeah. James, basically, he owns up with his agency, and he's also a Sandler franchise in The UK or something like that. Uh-huh.

[1:37:20] Founders (1557: Yeah. And he basically has, like, a monopoly of the entire Sandler ecosystem because he is a franchisee, and he has a side business where he services all the other franchises. Yeah. It's, like, totally cannibalistic. And rather than I'm not telling you.

[1:37:34] Founders (1557: If I went to their their franchise, like SKL, last year in April in the front window, and it was all global franchises required to attend. So I had a booth where they had the note taker set up a a credit card swagger, And they were showing, here's what Fathom can do because these guys are doing in person meetings because they're all old school pen and paper. Like, I mean, because, like, the average agent percent of franchisee is, like, 16 plus. And so Yeah. We they show that well, whatever mobile device, turn on Fathom, and it will record your call and produce a transcript.

[1:38:10] Founders (1557: They closed hundreds of people that day, hundreds of licenses if I showed them that simple thing right then. That's

[1:38:17] Founders (1557: I don't who's through the templates.

[1:38:19] Founders (1557: That's fine. We stopped looking with Xamarin specifically because they had one of the clients they referred over who's gonna be, like, 500 users. And the client said that AskElephant cannot connect to their CRM, cannot connect to their calendars, cannot connect to their email, and they were just gonna use the mobile app for support transcripts. And

[1:38:39] Founders (1557: When you say was not Do you mean Yeah.

[1:38:41] Founders (1557: They weren't Their IT team was, like, saying they're not willing to. Okay.

[1:38:44] Founders (1557: That's And

[1:38:45] Founders (1557: so I was, like, literally on the call, like, guys, you're gonna have a whole week of experience, and I'm not willing to risk AskElephant's brand for you to have that experience. Like, I think the extra stuff, and this isn't a fit. And that pissed off the Sandra reps, and we've not had a good relationship since. But we still have I actually stand by it. I like, if I agree with you.

[1:39:04] Founders (1557: Like Okay. For a company that big, we'd be fucking ourselves over for a year. So because they're just gonna come in, drain a ton of resources and churn because they're not gonna be some cases. Exactly. That's I think that takes a mile for Santa.

[1:39:16] Founders (1557: I agree with you, Jake. And, yeah, James is he he he is the gatekeeper behind all the stuff as well. Mhmm. And so unless he made money off of implementation, he's just not gonna push on. That's what you guys asked.

[1:39:27] Founders (1557: Our main contact at SalesLyft was Jordan, but at Sam, we had Lisa, Tim, Danny, and Kira, and a bunch of folks. We got Frank. It's It is. And you're right. They're all old, aged white ooze who have this good old voice system of selling.

[1:39:45] Founders (1557: And, anyways, they're often gonna fall

[1:39:48] Founders (1557: behind the. So that's okay.

[1:39:52] Founders (1557: But still love to get involved. Like, literally, if they were to come in and change their thinking about willing to integrate and move to the future, get a hold of both.

[1:40:01] Founders (1557: They they don't even use CRMs. Like, some of them usually show HighLevel and HubSpot. But Yeah. For their the the customers or the franchisees. Are you saying Sandler themselves?

[1:40:10] Founders (1557: Sandler themselves. The franchisees do not use CRM.

[1:40:14] Founders (1557: Oh, okay.

[1:40:15] Founders (1557: These guys are, like, literally pen and paper like that, and it's weird because the requirements to be a franchisee are you have to have a physical office in your territory, and your meetings are on-site with your customers, which is why you can't have, like, multiple franchises in the same state or sitting yourself up at franchises serving certain industries or just

[1:40:35] Founders (1557: They're sales coaches. So Yeah.

[1:40:36] Founders (1557: Was Yeah. It's just the sales methodology. It's really so we're say about Saint Paul Barrett. I think somebody

[1:40:45] Founders (1557: worst. Yeah. Anyways, anything else from your end, desk side, or side, any questions? Well, any question about the database you're doing for the deal stand up project in? Would you

[1:40:56] Founders (1557: want to send me that document that

[1:40:58] Founders (1557: you were showing with that data?

[1:41:00] Founders (1557: With spaces. I can't figure I out you a copy of it.

[1:41:05] Founders (1557: I'm trying to get curious. Again, this is coming from some of my in sales, but you mentioned that the people are not gonna be wanting to move on HubSpot into our platform. Like, I only invited them, I guess, and you're already slamming up calls, or is that that pretty wide across the org? So I'm wondering, like, how much value we're getting we'd get out of you being able to see deals within AskElephant and try to service, like, which ones are highest priority, the most or not, things like that. Like, do you not see value there?

[1:41:39] Founders (1557: I don't see AskElephant being the center of our reps universe. I think about more of the AE side versus the SDR side. The SDR is, like, power dialer and power email alert. Yeah. I do get all the stuff like that.

[1:41:52] Founders (1557: So I don't see them

[1:41:52] Founders (1557: Do AE's pause? Do they do they have an 85%? So look at something like that and shoot They're this. Yeah. Instead of this one, or they just don't even take that much time.

[1:42:01] Founders (1557: Like

[1:42:01] Founders (1557: I I remember looking. So I'm so sorry. I I wanted your answer too, but, like, when I when I was doing sales, it was, uh, like, if I was filling out documentation or I was trying to do, like, the reporting or send out, um, quotes or maybe I wasn't doing my job. Like, I was I was doing the paperwork, so it's like, how do I get this done as quick as possible to get onto the next call? Yeah.

[1:42:24] Founders (1557: So I just want to say.

[1:42:26] Founders (1557: So I don't spend all the time.

[1:42:28] Founders (1557: And so gathering context before a meeting is I would argue to say that's rare for most sales reps. They're sell they're do the hustle. They're gonna go off muscle memory, and they're gonna look at their digital records, and that's what they operate. It's a the contextual delivery of being, like, on that sub bar on the new record in HubSpot. That's what you can actually do to use it.

[1:42:53] Founders (1557: And, like, if they have a

[1:42:54] Founders (1557: meeting that's coming up, push the output of

[1:42:55] Founders (1557: their meeting prep workflow right there too. Like, those there's those are the putting the output where they work kind of things have been huge. You know? I I use reps now, and I build a long time. And I almost never have desk I my worst meeting prep at AskElephant is better than most of my best meeting prep for AskElephant.

[1:43:15] Founders (1557: Because, like, I go to a Google website maybe if the client was late to call.

[1:43:21] Founders (1557: So, like, Tom DePees, he was saying that he wanted to see the the gaps to fill. So, like, a bunch of, like, bullet pointed. Like, these are some like, here's your here's the deals that you own, and then here's, like, the next action you need to take here is, like, a few things that, like, you gotta close this gap. And so, like, we could sort that and even do some prioritization of, like, this is the one close to the finish line for you how to follow-up to do here. But if no one's gonna be in the platform at all, like, is there value, or do we have to figure out ways to show that through chess?

[1:43:53] Founders (1557: You just ask them what should I do next or really need to consult AskElephant to say that at all.

[1:43:57] Founders (1557: Honestly, pushing that stuff to customer right now is possible already. Yeah. The value part of having that in itself, my opinion still is. I do think there's still a drug and more supply. Yeah.

[1:44:08] Founders (1557: But if

[1:44:09] Founders (1557: you're in parallel with Clang,

[1:44:11] Founders (1557: or actually we give Clang as a service. You can use the exact same thing you're saying in Clang where I could just pull all my contact data, it would play table and understand the value props and the messaging and, you know, points that I need to know about someone. The the primary usage in play right now for the end users is the client data pushes into HealthSpring, and that's where we'll take a look at it because that's what they're either actually. They don't operate in claim. Like, most sales reps don't even don't even have a log of the cluster.

[1:44:39] Founders (1557: I think AD is the only one here who actually works in clay at all, but all the SDRs can use English.

[1:44:44] Founders (1557: I'm like, AD was this. She's like, How are these? Okay. So kinda similar parallels is you know? Yeah.

[1:44:50] Founders (1557: I think really compliance was so immediate to just stay small. So because the product is good outside of it.

[1:44:57] Founders (1557: Yeah. Single flow of work is powerful for the sales reps specifically and any CRMs. If they wanna go outside, where are they working? I told him it's just working. AskElephant.

[1:45:08] Founders (1557: Yeah.

[1:45:11] Founders (1557: I'm I'm on a journey for that chugging horse.

[1:45:13] Founders (1557: Oh, like, a year and a half. Okay. Yeah.

[1:45:18] Founders (1557: Cool.

[1:45:19] Founders (1557: That's super helpful. Thanks for all that.

[1:45:20] Founders (1557: Yeah. Of course.

[1:45:22] Founders (1557: Does that have anything, Miran? I know you can do that.

[1:45:25] Founders (1557: As you

[1:45:25] Sam Ho: guys know,

[1:45:25] Founders (1557: this has been super helpful, kind of,

[1:45:27] Sam Ho: you know, day three for me. So just trying to get a lay of the land and understand the perspective. I guess probably one thing I do think about. Right? Basically, you you kinda go in, ask the audit.

[1:45:38] Sam Ho: There's probably different things you see in terms of the way they structure. And then to that point of having opinionated, I wonder, like, if you're missing data fields, what's the reason for that? It's it's it's because no one updates them. You could add them. We all want that structured data as a manager, but no one wants to no one actually updates them, and then you have crappy data.

[1:45:57] Sam Ho: But if you could go in, would they be open to, like, you us creating, like, what we think is, like, the key data? And they never have to look at it. We just it's almost like hidden autofilled data based on the transcripts moving forward. That's what I think might be

[1:46:12] Founders (1557: Yeah. The the hidden auto fill data, Chris, I'm curious about. I think it's actually the superpower of AskElephant because, like, RevOps one zero one for the old way of doing things was the fewest fields possible to accomplish what you're looking forward for decision making and have reps will go out. Like, that's what you're trying to get to. And now I'm trying to get to any context I want to service later, be it for marketing product, resell of closed glass deals.

[1:46:36] Founders (1557: Like, whatever I wanna surface, I'm pushing the hidden fields, like, as often as I can. And I I am convinced that is the best practice of the future. I don't know if you agree, Chris, or not. Because it is not the best practice of the old world. It's not

[1:46:52] Sam Ho: And I don't wanna overload them. I I don't even know PubSlide has this, but I it's like if I could store it and I also come from kind of machine learning background, so we feed off of data. Right?

[1:47:01] Founders (1557: Um, so it's like view all these fields. Yeah. So if if you could

[1:47:05] Sam Ho: do that, then we can give you those insights without you ever having to look at. It's just that we store it in a we just parsed it, structured all your conversations to fill that so we can have deeper understanding inside, and RevOps can go in there and get whatever answer they want even though sales reps have never did anything. Exactly.

[1:47:21] Founders (1557: Yeah. There's there's nuances to consider with it. Like, where where does it live? What object is it driven on? What what HubSpot hub do they have?

[1:47:30] Founders (1557: Because they're limited on property creation potentially. You don't wanna cannibalize that as well in the sense of your you've maxed them out with one single meeting. Uh, and then the type of data as well is very important there in the sense of if you are auto filling in data points, the structure is going to matter a lot. And I I I've run into this quite a bit, especially with, like, the value prop agents that I'm doing right now, which is someone could phrase a value prop a certain way to customer to make them understand it, but we wanna track it differently in the back end, which is, hey. This customer resonated with data quality even though was phrased as your reporting is better.

[1:48:06] Founders (1557: You know I mean? So maybe it's a, like, translation process that'll happen with it, but I think it gets definitely valuable.

[1:48:11] Sam Ho: Yeah. And we could definitely do that kind of mapping. That's, like, a easy LLM problem to kind of solve that. But, yeah, all the feedback, I think, you know, as I've been learning the platform, yeah, I think, you know, you mentioned a good thing. Right?

[1:48:24] Sam Ho: When I look at a workflow, it's all just a bunch of blocks that don't tell me anything about what this workflow does. Right? And so, like, just having that quick summary, which is basically how I build agents in Claude, is is it, like, I also want just the summary. I don't wanna have to read through this thousand line agent. That's all natural language.

[1:48:44] Sam Ho: But at the top, it just says, hey. What does this agent do? Right? And I always have it create that summary so that I can quickly glance through that, and that would make things faster. So I think we could add definitely features like that that make it, you know, more simple.

[1:48:57] Founders (1557: Okay. Cool. We got another Zoom. Yep. Awesome.

[1:49:00] Founders (1557: Thanks for the rest of the

[1:49:01] Founders (1557: Well, Sam, good to see you. Yeah. Great chatting. Yeah. We'll be

[1:49:04] Sam Ho: in touch more as I get, uh, more up to speed and kinda figure out where we're going, and I'd love to kind of send those more there to think about, um, yeah, what else we can build in kind of longer term vision and revenue. Awesome. Thanks, everyone.

[1:49:15] Founders (1557: Thank you, sir. Cheers.
