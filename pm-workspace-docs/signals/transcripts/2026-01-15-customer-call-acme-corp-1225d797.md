# Customer Call: Acme Corp

Date: 2026-01-15
Attendees: John (Sales Rep), Sarah (CSM), Mike (Customer)

## Notes

Mike mentioned that the dashboard is really slow when loading more than 100 deals. He said "It's frustrating when I'm trying to show my team the pipeline and it just hangs there."

He also requested a feature to bulk edit deal stages. Currently they have to click each one individually which is a problem for their workflow.

Sarah noted that this is a common complaint - at least 5 other customers have mentioned the slow dashboard.

## Action Items
- Tyler to investigate dashboard performance
- John to follow up next week
