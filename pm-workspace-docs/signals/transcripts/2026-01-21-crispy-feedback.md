[0:00:00] Unknown Speaker 1: I'd like Okay.

[0:00:01] Unknown Speaker 2: Have conversations. Anyways, so this is super cool. Right? Like, this would be, like, insanely useful, like, as just, like, an additional impact for our clients. Promise that if we make it super easy for us to, like, simulate the fix and fix and go do that, then it, like, comes up with a question of, like, why is Crispy even needed?

[0:00:25] Unknown Speaker 2: Right? And, like, that's where it's like, okay. So, like, if we if we make it seem like, oh, we're kind of attacking his, like, business where he's going in the door, that's where, like, they're making their money, obviously. It's like, oh, shoot. Like, I don't want, you

[0:00:41] Unknown Speaker 1: know Yeah.

[0:00:42] Unknown Speaker 2: Sorry to go people to go around and, like, essentially, like, be able to fix this without no. Obviously, I there is there's another way to look at this, but I think that's, like, where he tries to fit his business out. Right? Where it's, like, he is the HubSpot partner to them where he's gonna come in and he's gonna fix it. He's gonna be the professional that walks them through, like, okay.

[0:01:01] Unknown Speaker 2: This is how you get from here to here.

[0:01:03] Unknown Speaker 1: Was it doing

[0:01:03] Unknown Speaker 2: Now not every client has that crispy. Yeah. And that's where I think this is, like, really cool. It's like that dish from a thing where it's like, oh, hey. Run a diagnostic.

[0:01:13] Unknown Speaker 2: Like that.

[0:01:13] Unknown Speaker 1: This guy just thinks he can steal my shirt. I'll get on my knees. I'm just kidding. No. You're fine.

[0:01:20] Unknown Speaker 1: I got him to talk

[0:01:21] Unknown Speaker 2: to Matt anyway. I just

[0:01:22] Unknown Speaker 1: I just saw that as a perfect moment. Perfect opportunity. I just don't see you anymore. You're too busy. Don't to I talk.

[0:01:31] Unknown Speaker 1: Used we used to be friends. I know. Now it is. But I mean, I

[0:01:36] Unknown Speaker 2: what you can say. It's like a

[0:01:37] Unknown Speaker 1: long walk away right in the middle of this. Just just what you're showing me the other day. I I do like, ignore that. I was telling them about this story. So Are you scrolling through something and then you're like, ignore that?

[0:01:49] Unknown Speaker 1: And you're like, what what was the teacher's showing me? Oh, just like you would it's like a second chance. She's like, alright. Well, I'm glad we got that recorded, buddy.

[0:02:14] Unknown Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, this is fun. Sweet.

[0:02:16] Unknown Speaker 1: Make this private. He's learning. Okay. It should've a word. So is it tell me a little bit more about Crispy's,

[0:02:30] Unknown Speaker 2: Yeah. So, like, here's my thought. Right? Like, if we were to present this to Crispy, right, it's, like, one of those things where it's, he wants to be that he wants to essentially do this. His company comes in and does this, and a lot of the HubSpot implementers do.

[0:02:44] Unknown Speaker 1: Right? And and by this, it's like, should run diagnostic. Is they want to do the diagnostic. Yeah. Essentially, it's like,

[0:02:51] Unknown Speaker 2: that's if we were to say, okay. Hey. Like okay. This is an example. I'm just gonna use this as, like, an example.

[0:02:59] Unknown Speaker 2: Right? So, like, some people love to drive. Right? They love, you know, the control or whatever. Right?

[0:03:04] Unknown Speaker 2: But then if you said, oh, hey. Tomorrow, we're gonna automate all driving to you. No steering wheels in any of the cars and blah blah blah. It's like, okay. And there's some of the people out there who are like, dude, that's awesome.

[0:03:15] Unknown Speaker 2: I don't have to do anything. I could do other things. That's great. Like, that makes my life easier. Other people say, I really like driving.

[0:03:22] Unknown Speaker 2: I like, that's my favorite part of my day. Right? And so it's like, this is, like, one of those things where it's like, it might seem if, like, we because I see what you're showing here. It's like, dude, that's this is so useful. It's just how we go about doing it and, like, the implementation is, like, the other thing.

[0:03:42] Unknown Speaker 2: Right? Where it's like and and I think that's where it's like, okay. When you click run diagnostic, And then you go to, like, this part right here. I love, like, this part because then it goes, okay. I can connect people to Crispy.

[0:03:58] Unknown Speaker 2: Like, that would help me build up my relationship with my future partners. Because it might not be Crispy. It could be calling at Force experts. It could be this, that.

[0:04:08] Unknown Speaker 1: He's a great guy, by the way.

[0:04:09] Unknown Speaker 2: Yeah. He's great. Like, there's like, I have partners in in which, like, they can bring stuff to the table for my partners. And then on the back end, it's like, hey. We scratch their back.

[0:04:20] Unknown Speaker 2: They wanna refer us more. Right? So that's the idea. Right?

[0:04:23] Unknown Speaker 1: So what if instead, this is not check your HubSpot health. This is a tool only for partners, and it's part of our partner program. It's like, hey. You spend so much time auditing HubSpot. We wanna give you more billable hours.

[0:04:37] Unknown Speaker 1: We want to actually increase your top line. So this

[0:04:41] Unknown Speaker 2: is And can it run like, whenever it runs the diagnostic, it runs it looking for their specific, like, how they go about their structure, how they go Exactly.

[0:04:49] Unknown Speaker 1: And it's not crispy. It's not it's not running it and seeing it for themselves. It's running it and him being the only one that sees it in instance to say, this is what they're missing based on what your methodology is. And so then now Crispy is looking at it and saying, hey. Here's the things that I need to do.

[0:05:08] Unknown Speaker 1: How many of this how much of this stuff can I just automate and add? How much of it, like, actually gives me billable hours? Because I think that Crispy provides a lot more value outside of this piece, which is which properties are missing and which associations are not there. It's like the workflows and the actual connections and Yep. The objects and templates.

[0:05:26] Unknown Speaker 1: It's like, how can we get him more billable hours, provide quicker service and diagnostics as well as also letting him do because it it's like, people love driving Yeah. But driving stick kinda sucked a little bit. Some people love it. It's like, hey. We want you to be able to not have to, like, shift gears to get to a high RPM.

[0:05:42] Unknown Speaker 1: It's like, just put your foot on the gas. What what are your thoughts on that?

[0:05:45] Unknown Speaker 2: No. And I like it. I like it. Like, it it makes a lot of sense. Like and I think that's where it's like, we shifted, like, how we give this is

[0:05:53] Unknown Speaker 1: like a tool

[0:05:53] Unknown Speaker 2: to a specific type of partner. Maybe we even upcharge for this specific type of tool. It's like, hey. You wanna go, like, forward with your your customers and, like, have access to this tool? Okay.

[0:06:04] Unknown Speaker 2: That's not gonna just be AskElephant premium. That's gonna be AskElephant, like, whatever, right, additional. So that'll allow us to go, hey. Like, we can upcharge to some of these people who are, like, running these diagnostic. And it's like, shoot.

[0:06:16] Unknown Speaker 2: The amount of partners that I have where it's like they're trying to see if it's, like, the AI forward, like, you know, we know how to do this and this. It's like, okay. Do you really? But if we had something where it's like, okay. Here's another thing.

[0:06:27] Unknown Speaker 2: Like, you can use AskElephant to connect in the HubSpot and help fix some of those problems.

[0:06:32] Unknown Speaker 1: So would it make sense to this this one is a good example. Deals missing contact associations. 847 associated. Mhmm. One button here could be, like, create association.

[0:06:43] Unknown Speaker 1: Like, there first off, there just isn't a a rule about that. And the other is, do you wanna update those 847 deals to find the contacts? It's like, okay. We're gonna run that you. It goes through and it says, we have a 100% match on 700.

[0:06:56] Unknown Speaker 1: 30 of those, we've got duplicates, and the other ones, we've got no idea. Do you want us to create those? And it's, like, helping them through that process.

[0:07:04] Unknown Speaker 2: This is really, like, really cool about it. I I love it. Like, everything you're saying up until this point, like The

[0:07:09] Unknown Speaker 1: whole purpose is to shoot it down. Like, this is, like, a crazy initial prototype. It took me no time at all. It's just to have the conversation.

[0:07:15] Unknown Speaker 2: Just to have the conversation. Yeah. I love it. I love where the potential is. But the toast definitely scares

[0:07:20] Unknown Speaker 1: you. The

[0:07:22] Unknown Speaker 2: it's just more so, like, I wanna make sure that, like, we're, yeah, we're not, like, not only stepping on toes, but, like, crushing, you know, toes. Yeah. Right? Because that could, like, even burn potential partnerships in the future. Right?

[0:07:32] Unknown Speaker 2: Like, we won't work with anyone generally who's trying to build out an Ask Elephant, right, like, on their end. Yeah. So it's like, okay. Hey. If there's overlap, it's like, okay.

[0:07:41] Unknown Speaker 2: Then the partnership doesn't make sense, and we'll just agree to go separate ways. So the goal is, like, obviously, in the HubSpot world, like, we work with a lot of HubSpot

[0:07:52] Unknown Speaker 1: partners. So

[0:07:54] Unknown Speaker 2: less of, like, a, oh, hey. Like you said, everyone has access to this. Every user or whatever, every owner has access, and they can just go in and do the HubSpot check, and it runs it and fixes them on their behalf. It's like, okay. Maybe instead of that, it's like, okay.

[0:08:09] Unknown Speaker 2: We can go say, hey, Crispy. You have a specific user base, and, like, you're gonna have this potential to, like, add on this service, here's something that we can do and build out on our end to speed up your work. Yeah. So you can

[0:08:25] Unknown Speaker 1: So it's tools for HubSpot partners and not just

[0:08:28] Unknown Speaker 2: Yeah. That would be interesting. And it's like, what would you charge for this? Like, I don't know. Like, $500 a month.

[0:08:36] Unknown Speaker 2: Right? Like, if this is, like, their main business, it's like, this is, like, helping them essentially go to them and say, hey. I fixed your HubSpot instance. It's like Yeah. That's a good question.

[0:08:46] Unknown Speaker 2: But, like, they would want essentially that to be almost, like, private. Creating that moat around their money making tool.

[0:08:56] Unknown Speaker 1: I'm leaving anyways. Anyways,

[0:09:01] Unknown Speaker 2: I I think definitely show this to James. Right? Because, like, he'll also, like, give you his thoughts. Because maybe I'm looking at wrong. Maybe it's like, oh, Chris, he doesn't even really care about this.

[0:09:10] Unknown Speaker 2: Like, he would love this. And it's like, Okay.

[0:09:12] Unknown Speaker 1: If it's available on the

[0:09:14] Unknown Speaker 2: web But or

[0:09:15] Unknown Speaker 1: Actually, that's why I asked you first is because I had a moment of, like, I don't wanna like, if it's not what he says and it's more scaring him, like, I wanna know what your business is so I can take it over. That's not the intention.

[0:09:26] Unknown Speaker 2: It's Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How do

[0:09:27] Unknown Speaker 1: we make his

[0:09:28] Unknown Speaker 2: job easier? Exactly. Like, the goal is to make his job easier, but, like, also at the same time, like, this is an additional tool for us to go out and, like, service our our clients. We have a lot of clients who have a bad bad bad bad husband instance, and so it's like, it does like, this would be cool. Right?

[0:09:46] Unknown Speaker 2: To where it's like, this done for me and connect me with a partner. It's like, okay. That'd be a great way, like, show also to a crispy way. Like, oh, hey. Like, we're trying to throw you in where we can.

[0:10:00] Unknown Speaker 1: K. That's super helpful. Alright. I'm going
