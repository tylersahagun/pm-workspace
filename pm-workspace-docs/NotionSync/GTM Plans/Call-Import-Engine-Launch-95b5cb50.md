AskElephant makes switching from Gong, Grain, or other call platforms painless—bring your historical calls with you and get AI-powered insights from day one.

## Target Segment

Primary: Competitive switches from Gong/Chorus/Grain (5K-50K calls)

Secondary: Multi-platform consolidation (RevOps-driven)

Tertiary: New customer onboarding (reduce zero-state friction)

## Key Messages

1. "Your data comes with you." - Import from 10+ platforms

1. "See value from day one." - Don't wait for first recorded call

1. "No engineering project required." - Support team handles it

## Launch Tier: P1 (Internal)
