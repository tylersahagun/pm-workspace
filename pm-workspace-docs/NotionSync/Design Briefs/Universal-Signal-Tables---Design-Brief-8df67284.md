## Overview

Create an AI-powered table interface that lets sales leaders explore engagement data through custom AI columns. The experience should feel like a "flashlight in the dark" — enabling exploration without requiring expertise.

Key design mandate:

> "Our version cannot scare people. That should be a banner." — Woody

## Design Principles

### 1. Simple Until You Need More

Progressive disclosure. Start with the simplest possible table.

### 2. Show AI's Work

Trust through transparency. Users should see what AI is doing.

### 3. Exploration > Configuration

Design for wandering, not destination.

### 4. Cost-Conscious by Default

Guide users toward efficient patterns.

## Key Screens

1. Empty State — Welcoming, not intimidating

1. Filter Panel — Left side, collapsible, smart defaults

1. Chat Interface — Persistent input at bottom

1. Builder Panel — Right panel showing column configs

1. Table View — Clean, spreadsheet-like

1. Progress State — Non-blocking background processing
