## Overview

AI-powered tables that let sales leaders explore engagement data through custom AI columns. Transform unstructured call data into structured, actionable insights.

Strategic Pillar: Data Knowledge, Trend Visibility

2026 Initiative: Workflow Builder / AI Assistant Tool

## Outcome Chain

```javascript
Leaders create AI-powered columns on engagement data
  → Extract structured insights from calls without manual review
    → Make data-driven coaching and strategy decisions
      → Improve rep performance and deal outcomes
        → Quota capacity and win rates increase
```

## Problem Statement

> "Right now, I cannot tell you which competitor has been brought up the most, if we win or lose." — Woody

> "Every sales leader pretends like they're confident, but they are tiny little kids inside crying." — Woody

## MVP Scope

- Engagements table with up to 5 AI columns

- Chat-assisted column building

- Conditional column execution

- Persistent saves with manual re-run

- No external enrichment in v1 (call data only)

## Key Decisions

1. Leadership tool (not for reps)

1. Persistent, not dynamic data

1. Chat + Builder hybrid UI

1. 5-column limit for MVP simplicity
