# GTM Brief: Release Lifecycle Process

## Overview

This initiative has two GTM components:

1. Internal enablement (primary) - Training Revenue teams on the new process

1. Customer-facing beta program (secondary) - Introducing self-serve beta features

Related PRD: prd.md

Status: Not Started

Launch Tier: P2 (Internal = P3, Customer Beta UI = P2)

---

## Value Proposition

### Internal

> "Always know what features are available, to whom, and when they're changing."

### Customer-Facing

> "Be the first to try new AskElephant features with our Beta Program."

---

## Target Segments

### Internal Audiences


### External Audiences


---

## Key Messages

### For Revenue Team

1. "Same view, same features"

1. "Weekly updates, no surprises"

1. "One source of truth"

1. "Beta badge = set expectations"

### For Customers

1. "Try it first"

1. "Your feedback shapes the product"

1. "Clear expectations"

1. "Easy control"

---

## Competitive Positioning

### Beta Program Comparison


### Differentiation

- Transparency: We show you exactly what stage a feature is in

- Control: You decide what betas to try, not us

- Speed: We ship faster because you can try things earlier

---

## Internal Enablement Plan

### Week 1: Process Rollout


### Week 2+: Ongoing Enablement


### Training Materials Needed


---

## Customer-Facing Launch Plan

### Launch Tier: P2

Justification:

- Self-serve beta is a notable feature

- Differentiates from competitors

- Worth a product email mention + KB article

- Not worth full campaign (internal process)

### Launch Activities


### Launch Timeline


---

## Messaging for Beta UI Launch

### In-App Notification

```plain text
🧪 New: Try Beta Features

Be the first to try new AskElephant features.
Go to Settings → Beta Features to get started.

[Go to Settings] [Dismiss]

```

### Email Snippet (for product update)

```plain text
## Try New Features First

We've launched our Beta Program! Now you can try
new AskElephant features before they're released
to everyone.

Go to Settings → Beta Features to see what's
available. Look for the Beta badge throughout
the app to know when you're using a beta feature.

[Try Beta Features →]

```

### Knowledge Base Article Outline

1. What is the Beta Program?

1. How do I enable beta features?

1. What do the badges mean?

1. How do I give feedback?

1. Can I turn off a beta feature?

---

## CS Talking Points

### When to Mention Beta Program

- Customer asks about upcoming features

- Customer is a power user who'd appreciate early access

- Customer is frustrated about feature gap (beta might address it)

### How to Introduce

> "Did you know we have a Beta Program? You can try new features before they're released to everyone. Just go to Settings → Beta Features. If you see something with a Beta badge, that means it's still being refined, but we'd love your feedback!"

### When NOT to Mention

- Customer is struggling with core features

- Customer has complained about instability

- Feature they need is in Lab (not ready for external)

---

## Metrics to Track

### Internal Adoption


### Customer Adoption (Post Beta UI)


---

## Open Questions

1. Beta program name: Just "Beta Features" or give it a name? ("AskElephant Labs"?)

1. Customer communication: Announce beta program broadly or let it spread organically?

1. Incentives: Any recognition for beta participants? (Early adopter badge?)

1. Feedback mechanism: Build in-app feedback or use existing channels?

---

## Summary


Focus is on internal process adoption first, then soft launch of customer-facing beta program without major marketing investment.
