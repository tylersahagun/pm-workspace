# Observability & Monitoring


### Lasting quality starts with a foundation of solid processes on the publishing side

1. Logging ✅

> Talked to Bryan (Nov 25th) and we're "not" going to focus on "Metrics" and "Testing" for now. We already have tracing, but some parts are broken, and Bryan spent a couple of days trying to fix it, but it still has some issues.

1. Metrics

1. Tracing

1. Testing

---

### Next to ensure processes don't burden the engineering team, good tooling is needed (DevX)

1. Logging ✅

1. Metrics

1. Tracing

1. Testing

---

### Now we need processes to ensure the above are being completed properly by engineering

1. AI tools instructed on what to look for

1. Linting rule where possible

1. CI tools

1. Alerts

---

### Then we need some great monitoring and alerts

1. Establish some examples of good monitors and dashboards

1. Establish good examples of ACTIONABLE alerts

1. Establish processing and docs for the same

1. Get to working adding monitor coverage

---

### Almost there but we need to think about what to do when the alerts go off

1. Establish alert protocol

1. Establish IR initiation threshold

1. Establish IR procedure

1. And sadly, establish IR post-mortem procedure to figure out what, in all of the above, was missing, and why.

### Yu-Chun:

We also should have a standard way to handle db level error msg and don't just let it bubble up to FE:

- Slack Thread 1

- Slack Thread 2
