Participants: Tyler, Woody, Adam, Adia, Matt, Skyler

## TL;DR

Universal Signal Tables aims to give sales leaders a "flashlight in the dark" — AI-powered tables for exploring engagement data and aggregating insights. Strong alignment with vision, but scope needs definition before PRD.

## Strategic Alignment: Moderate

Aligned:

- ✅ Strong outcome chain: Insights → Decisions → Revenue

- ✅ Human-centered: "Flashlight, not lighthouse"

- ✅ Clear personas: Sales Leader, RevOps

- ✅ Data Knowledge pillar support

Concerns:

- ⚠️ Scope creep risk (Clay comparison trap)

- ⚠️ MVP undefined

- ⚠️ Pricing model unresolved

## Key User Problems

> "I cannot tell you which competitor has been brought up the most, if we win or lose" — Woody

> "Every sales leader pretends like they're confident, but they are tiny little kids inside crying" — Woody

## Decisions Made

1. Leadership tool (not for reps)

1. Persistent, not dynamic data

1. Chat + Builder hybrid UI

1. Conditional execution for cost/focus

1. Prototype by Jan 8

## Next Steps

- [ ] Adam: Low-fi prototype by EOD tomorrow

- [ ] Adia: Clay workflow Loom videos

- [ ] Define MVP scope boundary

- [ ] Engineering spike on Annotations vs Universal Signals

## Recommendation

Discovery needed before full PRD. Define MVP boundary and get technical clarity first.
