# Growth Reflections

This folder contains periodic reflections to support Tyler's path to senior PM leadership.

## How to Use

Run `/reflect` when:
- You've shipped something significant (celebrate + learn)
- You hit a major roadblock (resilience + reframe)
- You're feeling misaligned with the work (values check)
- A quarter/sprint ends (growth assessment)
- You made a tough call (document reasoning for future Tyler)

Reflections are saved as:
`YYYY-MM-DD-[topic].md`

Example: `2026-01-21-privacy-agent-launch.md`
