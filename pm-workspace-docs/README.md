# PM Workspace Documentation

> This folder contains all PM documentation, research, and initiative artifacts for AskElephant.

## Strategic Context (Start Here)

The `/company-context/` folder contains the strategic foundation that guides all PM work:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `product-vision.md` | Core identity, mission, principles, anti-vision, leadership quotes |
| `strategic-guardrails.md` | Red flags, decision framework, alignment checks, pushback questions |
| `personas.md` | User personas with jobs-to-be-done and pain points |
| `tech-stack.md` | Technology overview |
| `integrations.md` | Integration landscape |

**The AI will automatically reference these** when using any PM command and will push back if initiatives don't align.

## Natural Language Support

You don't need to memorize slash commands. Just describe what you want:

| Say this... | AI will... |
|-------------|------------|
| "I have a transcript from a customer call" | Suggest `/research` workflow |
| "Build a prototype for the settings page" | Suggest `/proto` workflow |
| "Save my work" | Auto-run `/save` |
| "What's the roadmap?" | Auto-run `/roadmap` |

The AI recognizes your intent and either executes simple commands automatically or confirms complex workflows before proceeding.

## Strategic Alignment Built-In

The AI will **automatically push back** when:

- Outcomes are unclear ("What business outcome does this enable?")
- Personas are vague ("Which persona - reps, leaders, CSMs, or RevOps?")
- Evidence is missing ("What data supports this need?")
- Revenue impact is fuzzy ("How does this help us land/expand/retain?")
- Trust implications exist ("How does this interact with privacy?")
- Anti-vision territory ("This sounds like 'better notes' - what's our unique angle?")

This ensures initiatives are well-formed before investing in PRDs or prototypes.

---

## Common Workflows

### Create a New Initiative

1. Run `/new-initiative [name]` or copy `initiatives/_template/` to `initiatives/[name]/`
2. Fill out the PRD template
3. Add research notes as you gather them
4. Create prototypes with `/proto [name]`

### Analyze User Research

1. Use `/research [name]` command with the transcript
2. AI will extract insights AND flag strategic alignment
3. Review "Questions to Answer Before PRD" section
4. Address gaps before moving to PRD

### Create Project Documentation

1. Run `/PM [name]` after research is complete
2. AI creates PRD, design brief, engineering spec, GTM brief
3. Documents are synced to Notion automatically
4. Run `/proto [name]` to build prototype

### Create a Prototype

1. Run `/proto [name]` to build components
2. Components go in `elephant-ai/web/src/components/prototypes/[Name]/`
3. Run Storybook: `cd elephant-ai && npm run storybook -w web`
4. Test with `/validate [name]`

### Update Strategic Context

1. Add raw AI outputs to `floating-docs/`
2. Synthesize into `company-context/` files
3. The AI will automatically pick up the new context

## Tips

- **Natural language works**: Just describe what you want and the AI will suggest the right command
- Use `@` references in prompts to point AI to specific files
- Example: "Read @pm-workspace-docs/company-context/product-vision.md and evaluate this proposal"
- **Leadership quotes are in product-vision.md** - the AI will cite them when pushing back
- Run `/save` often to back up your work
- Run `/update` at the start of each day to get latest changes
