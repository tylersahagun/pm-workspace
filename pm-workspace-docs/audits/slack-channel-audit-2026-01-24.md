## Executive Summary

AskElephant's Slack workspace has 114 active channels organized across team collaboration, project coordination, external partnerships, and operational needs. The audit reveals a well-structured channel ecosystem with clear naming conventions (`team-*`, `proj-*`, `ext-*`) but some areas with missing purpose/topic documentation.

### Key Findings

- **47 members** in #general (appears to be full company)
- **50+ channels** without documented purpose/topic
- **Strong naming conventions** for external partnerships (`ext-*`) and projects (`proj-*`)
- **Clear team boundaries** with `team-*` prefixed channels

## Recommendations

### 1. Documentation Gaps
The following high-traffic channels lack purpose/topic documentation:
- **#customer-quotes** (37 members) - Add purpose
- **#competitors** (27 members) - Add purpose  
- **#access-requests** (45 members) - Add purpose
- **#growth** (31 members) - Add purpose
- **#customer-feedback** (21 members) - Add purpose

### 2. Potential Duplicates
Consider consolidating:
- `#ext-neuronova-aske` and `#ext-aske-neuronova`
- `#ext-signpost-askelephant` and `#ext-signpost-aske`

### 3. Low-Activity Channels
Consider archiving if inactive:
- `#team-dev-doc-scrape` (2 members)
- `#prompt-workflow-sahagun` (2 members)
- `#ext-clicklease` (3 members)
- `#ext-knotapi` (3 members)

### 4. Naming Convention Alignment
Some channels don't follow the `ext-*` pattern for external:
- `#clozeloop-scorecard` - could be `#ext-clozeloop-scorecard`
- `#digitalj2-onboarding` - could be `#ext-digitalj2-onboarding`

### 5. Missing Team Channels
Consider adding:
- `#team-product` - Product team discussions (currently scattered)
- `#team-marketing` - Marketing team (currently just `#marketing`)
