# GTM Brief: Call Import Engine

## Value Proposition

**One-liner:** Import your existing calls from any platform in minutes—not days—so you can start getting AI insights from day one.

**Expanded:** AskElephant now makes it easy to bring your entire call history from Gong, Fathom, RingCentral, and other platforms. No more starting from zero. No more waiting weeks for engineering. Just connect, import, and unlock AI coaching across your full call library.

---

## Target Segment

### Primary: Competitive Switchers

**Profile:**
- Companies currently using Gong, Fathom, Chorus, or other call recording platforms
- Considering switching to AskElephant for better AI capabilities, pricing, or integrations
- 50-500 employees, B2B sales-focused
- Have 6-24 months of historical call data they don't want to lose

**Key Concerns:**
- "What happens to all our existing data?"
- "How long will migration take?"
- "Will we have to manually re-tag everything?"

### Secondary: Dialer-Heavy Teams

**Profile:**
- Sales teams that do significant phone-based outreach (not just video)
- Using RingCentral, Zoom Phone, or similar VoIP platforms
- Currently don't capture phone calls or use a separate tool
- Want unified view of all customer conversations

**Key Concerns:**
- "Can you record our phone calls too?"
- "Will phone calls get the same AI treatment as video?"
- "Is this automatic or do I have to upload manually?"

## FAQ for Sales/CS

**Q: Which platforms do we support?**
A: Currently Gong (historical), RingCentral (ongoing sync). Zoom Phone, Fathom, and others coming soon. Check the capability matrix for latest status.

**Q: How much does import cost?**
A: First 1,000 calls free, then $0.10/call. For a typical customer with 2,000 calls, that's $100 total.

**Q: How long does import take?**
A: Depends on volume. <1,000 calls: ~1-2 hours. 1,000-5,000 calls: same day. >5,000 calls: 1-2 days.

**Q: Is our customer's data secure during import?**
A: Yes. Credentials are encrypted at rest, transmitted over HTTPS, and we only access the specific scopes needed for recordings. We never access CRM data, contacts, or anything beyond call recordings.

**Q: What if the import fails?**
A: Customers see real-time progress and clear error messages. Partial imports are preserved—we don't lose progress. CSMs can see status proactively.

**Q: Can customers import and keep using the other platform?**
A: Yes! Historical import is one-time. They can continue using both platforms during transition, then sunset the old one when ready.

**Q: What about ongoing calls from dialers?**
A: For RingCentral and Zoom Phone, we support ongoing sync—new calls import automatically on a schedule (hourly by default).

## Appendix: Competitive Intelligence

### Gong Data Export Limitations

- Export requires admin access
- Some customers report data behind paywall
- No official "switch to competitor" export flow
- Transcripts exportable, but recordings may require additional steps

### Fathom Data Export Limitations

- Limited API access
- Some users report data locked after subscription ends
- Manual download may be required for recordings

**Implication:** Position import as "we do the hard work for you" rather than "just give us your export."
