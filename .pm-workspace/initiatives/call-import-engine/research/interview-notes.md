# User Interview Notes: Call Import Engine

## Interview Details
- **Date:** 2026-01-07
- **Participant:** Internal stakeholder (transcript analysis)
- **Interviewer:** PM Copilot
- **Recording:** N/A (transcript provided)

## Context
- **Persona:** Internal (Sales, Engineering, Leadership perspective)
- **Current tools:** Ad-hoc scripts, manual integrations
- **Team size:** N/A

## Key Themes

### Theme 1: Platform Transition is Critical Onboarding Moment
> "Right now, when customers are onboarding, a lot of the conversation that we have with them is around transferring from one platform to another."

**Observation:** Import capability is not a nice-to-have; it's a make-or-break factor in competitive wins.

### Theme 2: Engineering Burden is Unsustainable
> "A developer writes a one-off script, uses it, and then it's not actually in the system."

**Observation:** Each import is treated as custom work rather than productized capability.

### Theme 3: Sales Confidence Gap
> "What we're trying to do is make some sort of clear process where a sales rep can confidently say yes or no."

**Observation:** Sales team is currently unable to give definitive answers, creating friction and lost deals.

### Theme 4: Inconsistent Integration Patterns
> "RingCentral—we have built our own application... But then for Zoom Phone we actually make users go in, create their own Zoom application."

**Observation:** Different integrations have wildly different user experiences and reliability.

## Pain Points
1. No standardized process for imports
2. No pricing clarity
3. No timeline commitments
4. Phone calls underserved (vs video calls)
5. Silent integration failures

## Current Workarounds
- Developer writes one-off scripts
- Back-and-forth between sales/engineering
- Customer sends credentials manually
- Reactive debugging when imports fail

## Feature Reactions
| Feature/Concept | Reaction | Notes |
|----------------|----------|-------|
| Self-service import | Positive | "Onboarding prompt, first 1000 free" |
| Status/progress bar | Positive | Explicit need mentioned |
| Pricing calculator | Positive | Sales enablement need |
| Backend queue | Neutral | Alternative approach |

## Jobs to Be Done
- **When I** am switching from a competitor platform,
- **I want to** bring all my historical calls with me,
- **So I can** immediately use AskElephant with full context.

- **When I** am asked if we can import from platform X,
- **I want to** give a confident yes/no with pricing,
- **So I can** close the deal without engineering back-and-forth.

## Quotes to Remember
> "The pain isn't 'capturing data,' it's getting it to a desired state fast."

> "This is just a treasure trove of data that we're missing out on just because we haven't had a process in place to manage it yet."

## Follow-up Questions
- [ ] Which platforms have the highest request volume?
- [ ] What is the average import size (call count)?
- [ ] What percentage of deals involve import discussions?
- [ ] Has Pipedream been evaluated for this?

## Synthesis Notes
This interview reveals that call import is a systemic problem affecting sales velocity, customer satisfaction, and engineering capacity. The core need is standardization—of process, pricing, and capability visibility.
