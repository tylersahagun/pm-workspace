# GTM Brief: Universal Signal Tables

## Value Proposition

**One-sentence:** Turn your team's call recordings into structured, actionable insights in minutes — no manual review, no waiting for RevOps.

**Elevator pitch:** Universal Signal Tables lets sales leaders ask any question about their calls and get instant answers. Want to know which competitors came up most this month? Which objections killed deals? What pricing concerns surfaced? Create an AI column, and we'll extract that data from every call automatically.

## Target Segment

| Attribute | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Company size | 50-500 employees |
| Role | VP Sales, Sales Director, Sales Manager |
| Team size | Managing 5+ reps |
| Pain level | High — currently using emotion/anecdote for decisions |
| Technical comfort | Moderate — uses CRM, some analytics, not SQL |

### Secondary: RevOps Leaders

| Attribute | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Role | Director RevOps, RevOps Manager |
| Pain level | High — constant requests for new data fields |
| Use case | Enable leaders with self-service; reduce bottleneck |

### Not Initial Target

- Enterprise (different motion, longer cycles)
- SMB (lower pain, less data volume)

## Key Messages

### For Sales Leaders

1. **"Finally answer questions you couldn't ask before"**
   - Which competitors come up most? Do we win or lose those?
   - What objections kill deals? Which reps handle them well?
   - Did we actually discuss next steps, or did we forget?

2. **"5 minutes, not 5 hours"**
   - Create a custom analysis in the time it takes to make coffee
   - No waiting for RevOps to add new CRM fields
   - No manual review of dozens of call recordings

3. **"Explore, don't just report"**
   - You don't need to know the question upfront
   - Iterate and refine as you learn
   - Find patterns you didn't know existed

### For RevOps

1. **"Unblock your sales leaders"**
   - Let them self-serve instead of waiting on you
   - Focus on strategy, not ad-hoc field requests
   - Maintain data quality with structured outputs

2. **"Signal setup in minutes, not hours"**
   - Old way: 2+ hours to configure complex annotations
   - New way: Describe what you want, AI builds it

## Messaging Framework

### Problem Framing
> "Sales leaders have thousands of hours of call recordings but no way to answer basic questions: Which competitors come up most? What objections kill deals? What patterns separate top performers? Today, getting these answers requires manual review or waiting weeks for RevOps to build reports."

### Solution Framing
> "Universal Signal Tables turns your conversations into a queryable database. Ask any question, get structured answers from every call. Build a custom analysis in 5 minutes, not 5 hours. Explore patterns you didn't know existed."

### Proof Points
- "One customer analyzed 500 calls for competitor mentions in under 10 minutes" (hypothetical, needs validation)
- "Reduced time from question to insight by 90%+" (hypothetical, needs validation)
- "Leaders report feeling more confident in coaching decisions" (hypothetical, needs validation)

### Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already have Gong analytics" | "Gong shows pre-built categories. Tables lets you ask YOUR questions, on YOUR terms." |
| "Our team won't use another tool" | "Leaders build tables. Reps don't need to do anything differently." |
| "What about data accuracy?" | "You see exactly what AI extracted. Edit, refine, and re-run anytime." |
| "How is this different from search?" | "Search finds individual calls. Tables aggregate patterns across hundreds of calls." |
