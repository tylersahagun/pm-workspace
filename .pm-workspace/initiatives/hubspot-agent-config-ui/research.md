## Summary

This initiative is driven by a single primary research input: an extensive discovery interview with James Hinkson, our most advanced internal HubSpot user.

## Primary Research

### James Hinkson Interview (2026-01-06)

**Full document:** [../../research/user-interviews/2026-01-06-hubspot-agent-configuration-james-hinkson.md](../../research/user-interviews/2026-01-06-hubspot-agent-configuration-james-hinkson.md)

**Key findings:**

- 100+ hours spent learning to configure HubSpot agent
- Partners abandon after 2 uses due to confusion
- Testing requires 10PM-3AM isolated sessions
- Zero visibility into what the agent does or why
- Complex prompts spread across 3-4 workflow nodes

## User Problems Identified

| Problem | Severity | Frequency | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No visibility into agent actions | Critical | Every use | "zero confidence that an admin or rep can find out why things were updated" |
| Testing is impossible | High | Every config | "testing is a nightmare" |
| Configuration takes forever | Critical | Every setup | "100 hours of chatting with AskElephant" |
| Partners abandon quickly | Critical | Common | "use it twice, don't know what it does, turn it off" |
| Inconsistent execution | High | Occasional | "runs only a fifth of the time, don't know why" |
| Complex field dependencies | High | Advanced use | "nightmare of a prompt...lives in three or four nodes" |

## Competitive Context

| Competitor | CRM Approach       | Limitation         |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Fathom     | 5 fixed fields     | No customization   |
| Fireflies  | Meeting notes only | No field mapping   |
| Gong       | Enterprise setup   | Complex, expensive |

**Our differentiator:** Custom configurations are what we sell that no one else does.

## Open Research Questions

1. How do other HubSpot partners experience the current configuration?
2. What templates would cover 80% of use cases?
3. How do partners who stopped using the agent describe their experience?
