# Setup Command

When the user says "setup", "@setup", or asks to configure the jury system, guide them through the interactive setup process.

## Trigger Phrases

- "setup"
- "configure"
- "initialize"
- "get started"
- "onboard"

## What This Does

The setup wizard customizes the Condorcet Jury System for the user's specific business by:

1. **Technical Setup** - Installs dependencies, configures API keys
2. **Business Context** - Captures company type, stage, industry
3. **User Personas** - Defines 2-5 target user archetypes
4. **Pain Points** - Documents problems being solved, objections, competitors
5. **Tech Context** - Understands users' relationship with AI/technology
6. **Configuration** - Generates custom archetypes and persona pools

## How to Run

```bash
python scripts/setup_wizard.py
```

## After Setup

The wizard generates:

- `config/workspace-config.json` - Full business configuration
- `config/generation-config.json` - Persona distribution settings  
- `personas/archetypes-custom/` - Custom persona templates
- `personas/generated/custom/` - Initial persona pool (100+)
- `examples/my-first-initiative/` - Ready-to-test initiative

## Quick Evaluation After Setup

```bash
python scripts/simulate_jury.py \
  --initiative examples/my-first-initiative \
  --jury-size 50
```

## Manual Interview Mode

If the user prefers to be interviewed conversationally rather than run the script, walk them through these questions:

### Business Context
1. What's your company/product name?
2. What type of product? (B2B SaaS, B2C, Enterprise, Dev Tools, etc.)
3. What stage? (Pre-seed, Seed, Series A, B+, Established)
4. What industry do you serve?
5. In one sentence, what problem do you solve?
6. What makes you different from alternatives?

### User Personas (repeat for each)
1. What's the job title/role?
2. Describe a typical user in 1-2 sentences
3. What are their 2-3 main goals?
4. What frustrates them most? (2-3 items)
5. What tools do they use daily?

### Problems & Context
1. Top 3+ pain points you address
2. What "jobs" do users hire your product to do?
3. What objections do skeptical users have?
4. What alternatives do users compare you to?

### Technology Context
1. Does your product use AI/ML?
2. How tech-savvy are your users?
3. What barriers to adoption have you seen?
4. What % of users are skeptical of new tools?

After collecting this, generate the configuration files programmatically.
