# Sample Initiative: Meeting Notes Sync

## Problem Statement

Sales reps spend 30+ minutes after every call manually entering notes into the CRM. By the time they get to it, they've forgotten key details. Deal data becomes stale and inaccurate.

## User Problem Identified

| Problem | Severity | Evidence |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Manual note-taking is time-consuming | Critical | "I spend more time on admin than selling" |
| Notes are incomplete | High | "I forget half of what was said by EOD" |
| CRM data is stale | Critical | "My pipeline is always outdated" |
| No accountability for updates | Medium | "No one knows if notes were entered" |

## Proposed Solution

Automatically transcribe meetings and sync key fields to CRM:
- Meeting summary
- Action items
- Next steps with dates
- Deal stage updates

## Target Users

- Sales reps (primary)
- Sales managers (visibility)
- RevOps (data quality)

## Open Questions

1. How much control do users want over what syncs?
2. What's the trust threshold for automated CRM updates?
3. How do we handle sync conflicts?
